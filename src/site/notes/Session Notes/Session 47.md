- Viktor revived a dead body, party finds out the parade got jumped and they got stabbed alot saying they wanted the cult gone.
- Mord says something a bout bringing their friend back, makes a joke about a man down the alley when viktor asks, viktor turns around and sees someone disappear down the alley.
- Viktor thunder doors after then, sees loads of people in the shadows and gets out of there.. 
- party approaches the shadows to talk to them but they all raise crossbows until a dwarven  machine painted in gold and white appears and starts to batter them. Mord casts darkness to hide the party. 
- Golem says mission complete and to follow them to the palace (resembles the dwarvern golems that we sent from earthgrog)
- Goes into the council chamber to see steve and keith horrigan. Steve recounts events and he said loads of people appeared  and rebelled. The golems showed up saying they were here to help and slaughtered the rebels.
- Steve got the harpy back by writing a letter and lying about his leg being cut off
- Aidan wonders off into the night, viktor notices and gets the others to follow him.
- Aidan sees shadowy figures looking at schematics stating "point this at the tower and its over", he gets noticed and one of the figures start looking for aidan. He makes a distraction and uses it to get away
- Aidan runs into the party and catches them up to speed. They make a plan to distract them.

- They get to a old house, the figures do a secret knock and enter the password "Fairytale" to the guy behind the draw.
- Mord and Dragche convince the figures that they had to go, one figure follows them to make sure they're okay. They round the corner to see Viktor wearing a plague doctor mask, he casts his channel divinity onto the guy which doubled the damage of mords shocking grasp. The guy said "ooo are you into that stuff too, my turn now" then punches mord. Mord has a back and forth jest with the guy and hits him with a fire bolt
- Viktor appears from the shadow, calls him not pretty and banishes him to a demiplane.
- They run back to the palace, see the schematics are for a huge cannon and go to sleep
- they all sit on one stool in the morning and discuss circumstances (kal/lost haven)
- Viktor gets his brain broken by god knowledge, runs out the door and dissappears.
- The building shakes, mord evacutes the building into the dungeon
- Seifer takes over mord and walks him outside to see a vulture like figure hunched over eating the old dead bodies of the parade
