The Ashen Campaign is divided into multiple Sagas to help keep everything organised and understandable. They appear as follows:

### Echoes of the Ethertwist
This is the opening Saga, which introduces us to the world and its basic characters, like the Gods and Harps, and the various nations and histories that will guide the story going forward. Echoes of the Ethertwist mostly follows the players as they form [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Fatebreakers]] and hunt down [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]], a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Unfortunately, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] hadn't started note-taking yet, so notes on this part of the campaign are sparse. This Saga began in [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] and ended in [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]]. 

### The War For The [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]'s Freedom
This Saga marks the first time [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] has been able to leave the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. They went to gather allies in a long-brewing war against [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]]. The Saga ends in a climactic final battle with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] against the empire's emperors, Galen Verix, and his two generals, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]] and a resurrected Caden Steelbreaker.

This Saga began with the assassination of Caden Steelbreaker, which threw the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] into chaos and set [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] on a desperate quest for allies against the looming threat of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]]. Their journey was marked by profound loss, strange discoveries in an ancient dwarven city, and fraught diplomatic efforts in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], all while being manipulated by the mysterious Auditor, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], who was revealed to be behind the initial assassination.

The Saga culminated in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] being ensnared by criminal contracts and personal vendettas, forcing a dramatic prison break with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s aid. This alliance set the stage for the impending war, where [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s strategic brilliance, specifically [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]'s plan to neutralise [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]]'s navy, led to a decisive victory and secured the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]'s freedom.

### 3rd Saga - The Worst Diplomates
[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] travels to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] in search of lucrative trade deals to support the nation. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] began their journey by escaping a mimic disguised as a house and travelling to [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]], where [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] revealed his noble heritage, causing tension among the group. They sought influence with local lords and ventured through [[Locations/Ehobel/Nas Anor\|Nas Anor]], selling valuables and surviving ambushes by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|elven cannibals]]. Their travels led them to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], where [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] uncovered secrets tied to ancient towers and mysterious entities, sparking internal conflict. The group faced illusions in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]], cult uprisings, and divine temptations, all while battling mummies and solving deadly puzzles in a cursed pyramid. After defeating the Mummy Lord and escaping through a collapsing ruin, they pressed on despite growing moral dilemmas and strained relationships.

In the final arc, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] rescued [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] from Tulan Fort, endured betrayals and time distortions, and infiltrated [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], now corrupted by purple magic. Forced into a contract with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]], they fought necromancers in search of a crystal in the crypts below the great city. They retrieved a crystal from the crypts, only to learn that a sacrifice was required. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], gravely ill, chose to give his life, triggering a cataclysm that erased [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and left the survivors grief-stricken but determined. 

### 4th Saga - [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] Beckons
In the wake of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]’ death, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] found a young boy named [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] falling from the sky. They were incredibly gifted with magic and a little too familiar to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]. Travelling to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]], they sought refuge under [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s magical abilities. Still, tensions flared when his devotion to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] was revealed. Their climb to a ruined castle brought [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] face-to-face with a cursed crown, sparking temptation and heated conflict before Aidan intervened. At the summit, they battled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]], the red dragon. They claimed victory, only for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] to appear and chastise them for the consequences. Pressing onward, they uncovered secrets about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|the Auditors]], endured [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] mishaps, and faced shocking revelations at [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] stripped away illusions and forced them into a brutal fight against an Aspect of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. Afterwards, drunken chaos and a botched summoning left [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] bound to a demon, while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] spiralled into an existential crisis.

Their journey grew darker as Aidan endured trials in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] to confront his past, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wrestled with family trauma, and prophetic dreams hinted at [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]]’s influence. They crossed [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]], recruited [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]], and incited a revolt at Tulan Fort before fleeing on an ice spider. A divine fragment possessed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], leading to a horrific ritual that birthed [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]], forcing [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] into a desperate extraction. Later, they fought the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] known as the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under the Well]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] and encountered [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] herself. In [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]], they awakened [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]], a dwarven commander reborn in an Automaton body, forging a powerful new ally. 

### 5th Saga - Freedom's Flame

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] travelled from the Wyvern’s Cave to [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]], where tensions rose as [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] confronted his violent past and fought a sacred duel. Soon after, they were captured and enslaved in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], stripped of magic and forced into brutal labour under an antimagic field. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] relived his traumatic history, revealing his failed rebellion and true identity as [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal]], which inspired a new uprising among the oppressed. As the group plotted revolution, they battled disease, infiltrated the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]], and uncovered that the antimagic field was powered by a crystal within the king’s palace. Their efforts split [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] infiltrated the palace through the sewers, discovering a golden mech piloted by Sera, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]’s former ally. At the same time, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] ignited rebellion in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]]. Chaos erupted as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] decreed mass slaughter, forcing [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] into a desperate assault on the palace.

The final battles were brutal. Reunited, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] fought Sera’s golden mech, destroyed the crystal, and restored magic, but Sera’s death left [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] shattered. Their confrontation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] escalated when the tyrant transformed into a towering golden golem. In a desperate act, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] sacrificed himself, channelling forbidden power to annihilate the golem, dying as a symbol of freedom. His soul was claimed by [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], leaving [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] horrified as a corrupted version of [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] vanished into the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]]. In the aftermath, riots shook [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. At the same time, the group mourned their fallen friend and tended to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s worsening lung rot. Joined by [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor Malkovich]] and aided by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim]]’s device, they prepared to journey toward [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].

| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]]               | 7th Saga - Winter Warriors               | The party’s attempt to rest devolved into cursed hunger, undead experiments, and growing dread as Mordecai spiralled under wild magic and the hunters’ curse was partially unveiled. Dawn brought divine horror: the Korrigan struck Mordecai down, Vaelrith answered Viktor’s prayer, and the road to the Golden Fort grew far darker than expected.               |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]]               | 7th Saga - Winter Warriors               | The party barely survived a devastating ambush by cursed hunters and a giant, saved only by desperate healing and Chenris’ catastrophic fire magic. Victorious but shaken, they uncovered troubling hints about the Hunter Society and settled into an uneasy camp, aware that greater dangers lie ahead.                                                           |

With new threats lurking in the blizzard, their northern journey has only just begun.                                                                                   |

Returning to Blackwall, they planned their next move, only for Halfbie’s nightmarish vision to unsettle them all with a chilling omen.                                                                                                  |
