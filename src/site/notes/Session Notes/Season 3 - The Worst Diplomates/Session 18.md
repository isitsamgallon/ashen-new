# Session Summery
After their previous ordeal, the party arrives at the gates of [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]], where they encounter a peculiar city that morphs based on each person's desires and needs. Aidan sees a city filled with hot springs and massage parlors to heal and reflect, Kal views wells and stores of mana potions to regain his depleted magic, Mordecai perceives an aerial obstacle courses and theme park rides, and Chenris envisions a library of cannibal research due to his curiosity about the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]]’ regenerative powers. Suspicious of the city’s appearance, Kal prompts Mordecai to cast "Dispel Magic," revealing the illusion. Despite Mordecai’s warning, the others are engulfed in their respective visions, leading them to enter a building that each sees differently. Inside, Mordecai sees reality—a shack with over fifty entranced [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]]—and becomes determined to break his companions free from their delusions.

Mordecai and Chenris work together to uncover the illusion’s source, but their efforts are hampered by the enchantments that distort perception and create illusory versions of their friends. Mordecai's attempts to communicate with his allies through magic are misunderstood, as Kal mistakes the magical messages for demonic influences. Chaos ensues when Mordecai and Chenris attempt to physically pull their friends out of the illusions, resulting in Korrigan attacking what he perceives as a demon. The situation escalates when [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]], a malevolent entity tied to their past, manifests, and decapitates the entranced [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]], further complicating the rescue effort. Concurrently, Chenris is drawn into a direct confrontation with the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]], the entity responsible for the city's illusions, who offers him a deal to live in a fabricated paradise. Chenris refuses, prioritizing freedom and reality over the comfort of illusions.

Back at camp, tensions flare as the group deals with the fallout from the illusion and the unresolved issues within their ranks. Mordecai and Chenris share a tense but revealing conversation about their struggles with their pasts and the burdens they carry. They confront the notion of their self-worth and purpose within the party, leading to a rare moment of vulnerability from Chenris. The group's unity is tested further when Korrigan reveals a secret deal he made with a deity, creating more uncertainty about their path forward. As they prepare for the challenges ahead, the party must navigate both external threats and their internal conflicts, each member grappling with personal demons and the weight of their choices.

# Full Session Notes
After the event of the last session, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] reach the gates of [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]. however, the city appears differently depending what people are wanting and needing at the time. here is what they see 
- [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] - Aidan is quite hurt and needs a place to sit down and think through what happen when he healed his horse with magic towards the end of [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]]. This results in him seeing the city has full of hot springs and massage parlours. 
- [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] - Korrigan is extremely drained and has no spell slot left, making his priority to find away to regain his magic. This results in him seeing the city being full of mana potion wells and stores.
- [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] - Mordecai is currently on an adrenalin high from sprouting wings in combat and dying twice. This results in the city appearing to have many aerial obstacle course and what look like theme park rides.
- [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] - Chenris is currently reeling on the fact that the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] had the ability to regenerate and needs to figure out how. This results in the city being full of hooded robes figures with books and many signs that say "Magical Cannibal School" on them. 

Although all of this strike incredibly everyone as quite weird, the majority of them don't question it go to enjoy their own delusions. This was until Korrigan realises something and asks Mordecai to cast [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic) to see if that did anything. Mordecai only had enough spells slots to cast it once on his own perception and now see [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]] for what it is, an illusion. However, he is unable to convince people otherwise. They all continue on to, what to Mordecai looked like a wooden shack, but for the rest of them, it was what they wanted to see. At the last minute, Korrigan and Mordecai try blind folding chenris try and distract him but he is able to see the 'world' just fine. They let him walk in. Everyone enters the build and this is what they see:
- Mordecai sees it as medium room with over 50 [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] huddled in acting out their own delusions. when the party enters, Mordecai sees that their eyes glaze over
- Aidan sees steams that covers his eyes and disorientates them until the steam clears to reveal a huge and beutifulo marble bath house with massage tables and hot springs to bathe in. Aidan decides to get a massage on the the table. In reality he just lies on the floor.
- Korrigan gets some mist and after it clears he see mages in robes and huge jugs of mana potions being poured into a big pool. Korrigan stops caring about the group and just wants to enjoy the mana potion. Korrigan drinks the potion.
- Chenris sees steam as well, it clears to revel a big roaring fire at the centre of a huge library. There are researchers everywhere and the walls are lined with books. there are even large cages of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] used for study. Chenris finds the head researcher, who is wearing a golden hood and asks for any materials on the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]]. The research reaches into his coat and pulls out a book. 
	- The book tells him that the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] are able to come back because on their healing factor. [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] naturally have a high healing factor, however, once they go feral and become [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] that healing factor increase exponentially. 
- Chenris starts to questions the book when he really starts to analyse it and realises that a healing factor can not be the only solution and it must be due to some kind of curse(like for some kind of powerful being). upon questioning this to the head researcher, the researcher responds by saying "of we hadn't thought of that, you must be some kind of expert". This rings major alarm bells for chenris as how could he have more information than an institution who is dedicated to researching something. He turns to leave and joins Mordecai outside the wooden building.

(x:: Mordecai is incredibly happy that he seems to have gotten a one up on Chenris and starts really hammering it in to chenris. eventually he stops and they come up with a plan together to test what is really going on. Chenris states the situation they are in feels incurably similar to what they faced in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Newhall\|Newhall]]. The plan they come up with is that both of them will enter the building again and Mordecai will cast [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) on chenris to see what happens. If Mordecai doesn't contact Them with message within one minute then he will leave. )

(x:: Set on their plan they walk in but Chenris sees the mist again, it fades to reveal the inside of a wooden building, with no [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]], with Not-Mord walking in after to them. Not-Mord tries to take chenris on a different plan and even starts to compliment chenris on how smart he is. This immediately make Chenris werey and says "well you're not Mordecai are you?" Not-Mord manages to convince him that nothing is wrong which calms chenris down. It is at this point, Mordecai messages him, asking what's happening, Chenris replies with "Say transmutation right now". Not-Mord smiles and asks whats wrong, did you need to do anything before they start their ritual. Chenris excuse himself and walks out the room.)

(x:: Reconvening outside again, Chenris explains what he saw and they both decide that they need to get everyone out. the decide to get Aidan's horse and pull them out with rope. Chenris runs to get the horse )

(x:: Back inside the building Korrigan 'feels better' after drinking the mana potion and decides to cast [Cure Wounds](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-cure-wounds%23:~:text%3DA%2520creature%2520you%2520touch%2520regains,At%2520Higher%2520Levels.&ved=2ahUKEwiYucj33aaIAxXR0wIHHbUvIucQFnoECBcQAw&usg=AOvVaw1lN5lCcJqPacE4-s9kE_BT) on himself. in reality he isn't healed, the illusion just makes him feel and look better. Korrigan thinks that the other must also be low on magic and decides to go find them to give them all potions. At that moment, Not-Mord, Not- Chenris, Not-Aidan and Not-Drache walk in and see hi. They raise alarm bells for korr when Not-Chenris says Korrigan is so much better than them at most things. he believes him (Due to a low roll). They talk for a bit and Not-Aidan slips up about [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] and makes Korrigan suspicious. Korrigan casts [Detect Magic](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-detect-magic&ved=2ahUKEwj-3Zmg36aIAxX27wIHHTajCtAQFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1V02h46WSA4J4TfBZJBW94), in reality he has no spell slots left and the magic fails. Korrigan detects some residual time energy on Not-Aidan which makes sense given that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] had just processed him. )

(x:: Aidan, having finished his massage is now relaxing in the hot springs. in reality he is just sitting in the corner naked. He is spending some time thinking over the events of the last session with his horse. Mordecai messages Aidan to tell him he can see his balls. he realises that he is naked in a hot spring, which freaks him out for some reason and rushes to get his clothes on )

(x:: Chenris gets the horse and Mordecai tries to tell Korrigan its all fake and Korrigan believes its demons trying to contact him. He starts to try and throw up thinking there must be something wrong with the potions. When Mordecai tries to tie the rope around him, Korrigan sees it as a demon hands reaching out of no where to grab him. Korrigan immediately attack with thorn whip to pull it out of the shadow. Korrigan see it as a demon coming out of a portal. Korrigan and the rest of the  Not-Party get ready to attack as Korrigan attacks again and deals big damage to Mordecai. Mordecai pulls on the rope and chenris gets him out of there. Korrigan is freaked out and tries to leave but the Not-Party tries to tell him to stay so Korrigan leaves.)

(x:: Mordecai explains what happened and Korrigan tries to heal him but he can't due to his lack of spell slot. Suddenly Chenris gets infatuated with what is going on inside the wooden building. even going as far as to think that all of his questions could be answered if just walked in. )

#### The Party POV
(x:: With Chenris nowhere to be found, the party decide to go on the offensive and try to imagine as many things as they can that they've seen on their adventures. Korrigan especially thinks about all the strange things found in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. This course the illusion to glitch before Korrigan is put in a black void where he hears "Stop being so annoying, have some time out" Korrigan shouts back to give him chenris back, its not like he could hurt either way. At that moment, Korrigan sees a window showing Chenris talking to a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Mysterious Man]] sat at a large table with a feast with many people pointing bows at chenris, read to kill him at any point. )

(x:: Meanwhile, Aidan starts thinking more about his procession and inevitable the fact that he is being hunted by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. Suddenly, it appears next to Aidan. He manages to look away before taking any damage and starts to have a panic attack and curls in a ball. )

(x:: [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] then turns its attention to Mordecai who is trying to get into the wooden building by tearing down the door. He make some headway when [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]] appears infront of him. Mordecai is now looking him in it's not face. recognising it immediately he looks away. Mordecai decides to use message to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the haunter]] and says "leave, there are easier pray elsewhere". [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The haunter]] laughs and replies in kind "There sure is, but you should have freed me when you could". Suddenly it turns around and decapitates the majority of the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] under the illusion and then disappears, leaving Mordecai covered in their blood.)

#### Chenris' POV
(x:: Chenris enters a portal and there is notably no fog that clouds his judgement. He is in an empty marble room with a man with a staff standing in the middle. The man introduces himself as the person who controls all of the illusions. He invites Chenris to sit down and chat. Chenris joins him at the nearly summoned banquet table. The man gets straight to he point and asks why is chenris trying to ruin the illusion. Everyone seems happy with it. why not just leave it be. Chenris states that he is not trying to ruin it. His party have quite a lot of things to do and they just want to leave and get on with this lives. At this this the man brings out a a [[Locations/Strixhaven\|strixhaven]] dossier and states, he has been researching the party. although they have done some good, they have also done a few "… counterproductive actions" in reference to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. )

(x:: The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]] tries to make a deal with chenris by saying that he can offer protection for the party, even from the Gods. Chenris raises his doubts about this and ensure him that tricking the mind can do wonders. Their end of the deal is that they have to stay in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]] - forever. Chenris refuses. The man tries to reason that is it not good to give the party everything they have ever wanted? He then goes on to list all of their latent desires one by one:)
- Aidan wishes to be rid of Chronovorus and to have never experienced his trauma at the hands of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]]
- Mordecai could have [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|his mother]] back
- Drache could have the freedom to do as his wishes and be with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]
- Korrigan could finish his business in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]].

(x:: Chenris declines again saying that none of that would be real. The man asks how does he know anything is real. For all we know. this would could just be controlled by 5 people making us do their bidding. Chenris responds in kind: )

	"You know i once had old friend of my mine who studied the school of illusion, and i asked them that very same question. Do you know what their response was? It was reality is what we make of it and how we connect with it.
	
	You propose a type of peace that is fake and not earned, and this so called life you wish to give us would all be controlled by you. You make it seem like true peace and safety can not be archived through a genuine understanding of the world and those that inhibit it and only in your artificial dream world. People should be free to make their own choices, not forced to live in a false reality designed by your machinations. I value individual freedom and the right of people to shape their own destinies, whih you wish to take away. I would rather go back to reality, because no matter how perfect this world may seem it's all in my head and I can't live and love with only myself. And I would never feel comforted that way, because the very same illusionary friend i mentioned before, will not be the same one that i came to. So you dream world can piss off"

Chenris move to leave the room but as he does, the man says "That's a shame in deed, but i did all i could. just know your choices may lead to the worlds demise, your friends have already proven me right"

(x:: Chenris asks how this could be and the man explains what has happened while he was away with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. Chenris says )

(x:: "That sure is a shame, but it does seem like your protection does little good doesn't it?" and leaves. He returns to reality and assesses the situation. He finds covered in blood with the bodies of around 20 [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] scattered headless around the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. Mordecai confront him, shouting and screaming that this blood is on both of their hands. all he needed to do is burn that stupid note. Korrigan perks up when he hears this and asks to see the note. Chenis laments and pulls out [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]], now covered in blood, burns and fraying at the edges and explains the significance of the note. Halfway through the explanation Korrigan interrupts and uses Thorn Whip to steal the note from chenris. Before anyone can do anything Korrigan has his bow and starts to aim at the note, intending to destroy it. )

(x:: Mordecai screams NOOO and jumps in front to take the arrow and save the note, falling unconscious in the process. Chenris is frozen in shock when suddenly [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] comes out of nowhere screaming and firing off a [Scorching Ray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray) to defend Mordecai from what she thought was an attack. Chenris furious tries to retrieve his note  but fails as Korrigan starts to turn on him. Korrigan demands that Chenris heals Mordecai. Saying )

"This is a debt you can avoid and it must be paid in full, this man gave his lift to protect something of yours"

(x:: Chenris sighs and leaves a potion at Mordecai's body, Korrigan now angrily shouts at chenris for refusing to help even when his comrade is down. Chenris ignores him until he hears the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|illusion master]] speak in his mind saying "See, more actions that don't help the world" chenris gets frustrated and heals Mordecai with magic and then says "There's a rather annoying man who controls this place and i'd rather not prove him right" and leaves)

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] catches up with the rest of the group and tries to help Mordecai up. Korrigan tries to help but is shooed away by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]. She helps Mordecai up and tries to feed him the potion to get more of his health back. Mordecai rejects the offer and apologises for what she just saw. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] says that she wanted to see all of the world and adventuring that includes the bad and the good. Mordecai laughs sayings that he not sure how much longer the party is going to last. she nods and quietly walks by herself, deep in thought)

(x:: Later on in camp, Korrigan tries to explain his actions to chenris but he is unresponsive. he tries to chenris that the physically items don't matter its the memory behind the object that matters and chenris surly has the not memorised by now. Chenris is feeling so many strong emotions at this point, His form is changing through all the seasons in very quick succession. He does not respond. )

(x:: Korrigan, feeling a bit lost and defeated, says that the party needs to trust each other and and to do that we need everything on the table. He starts to explain his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. She brought him back to life so he could settle his business in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] and make sure the tower in there falls. The party is stunned into silence. Chenris without looking up replies "i'll take first watch" )

#### Mordecai & Chenris' Watch
(x:: Even though it has a few hours now, Mord has refused to clean the blood off his hands and asks Chenris about the note. They talk about how Chenris needs to let go of the note since he said himself that he doesn't know why he cant let go. Mordecai suggest talking about it by chenris doesn't know the words to express himself coherently. Mordecai then asks him just tell him how he felt in the moment his professor died. Chenris replies)

	"I guess in that moment i must have felt guilt, anger and disgust at myself. I was powerless to save him i was powerless to know i had done something wrong before it was too late. I was powerless as his body lay in my arms slowly dying. He wouldn't have been there if i hadn't asked him, no begged him to put me on the list for that field trip he would never had died
	
	But most of all disgust, disgust in my very being because in that moment, deep in a dungeon with perhaps the only parental figure i had dying in my arms i realised some thing. Even with my elongated lifespan as an Elf i would still die before i leant all the secrets of this world and solved the last request Leotoris ever gave me. 
	
	If we're digging into my past tonight, I suppose that is why i entered the restricted section of the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] library and subsequently was removed for the institution. How was that for words you emotional boy?"

(x:: Mordecai slowly laughs as he realises that Mordecai and Chenris are to similar for comfort and even have similar goals. He explains that chenris cant solve his problems with words and research alone and sometime all you have to do is feel them out. At this point Chenris' emotions stabilise and land on sadness and for the first time in hours he turns to face Mordecai with singular tear falling down his face and says the following while trying hold back the tears:)

	"B- b- bu- but if let down this long stead fast wall within me i'll become naught but shrivelling husk of a man. ill no longer be a person that can research and know things to aid the party. My curiosity will be replaced with a sense of wallowing pity. i will no longer be useful and you will no longer have need for me. "

Mordecai responds:

	"Chenris you are defined by how useful you are to the part- no the world. Chenris we would gladly have you aboard whether you're a know if all or not"

Chenris goes quite, deep in thought. Mordecai turns away and finally washes the blood off his hands and wakes up Aidan for his watch.

#### Chenris, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] & Aidan's Watch
(x:: Clearly exhausted from all the conflicting emotions he had been feeling today eventually falls into a deep Trance leaving Aidan and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to watch. Aidan asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about deals with Gods. She Confesses that she isn't very familiar with them, she just knows they're not a good idea. Aidan says its a bit too late for that and asks if Gods have been known to grant people power in return for deals. She sighs and explains that the Gods have been known to do this and explains that there was legend of even [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] giving special powers to some kind of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|high priest]] back during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. Aidan reveals he made a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] advises that too much of a Gods influence can be "ill advised". The rest of the watch goes unhindered.)

#### Korrigan & [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' Watch
(x:: Korrigan wakes up for his watch and immediately spots chenris slumped down and makes an effort to sit him up and leave na open book on his lap. Before Aidan falls asleep, Korrigan talks to how they both have deals with God for power and they agree to train each other in magic. He also congratulates on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]] taking action to defend the party.)

#### Morning
(x:: Everyone wakes up and Korrigan asks Chenris if had properly thanked Mordecai. Chenris ask what for Korrigan explains that Mordecai risked life and limb to stop his stupid note from being destroyed and chenris should thank for Mordecai it. Mordecai says not force but chenris ends up giving a short thanks to Mordecai and walks away in embarrassment.  )

(x:: Mordecai explains that if they were going to do it properly they might need to redo the entire [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|ritual]] again since they don't know how it all works. Korrigan asks what [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the haunter]] actually said to Mordecai and reiterates its message. )

--Session End--

# Trivia & Notes
- [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] doesn't appear in this session due to Caleb not being able to join the session due to work.
