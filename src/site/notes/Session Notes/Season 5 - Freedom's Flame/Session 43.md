Season 5 - Freedom's Flame# Session Information
**Session Date:** 27th Jul 2025 
**Saga**: 5th Saga - Freedom Fighters
**Attendance**: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]]

# Session Summary 
The session began with the Party waking to their gruelling routine in the mines, only to discover that Mordecai, Korrigan, and Drache had contracted Lung Rot, a deadly infection caused by coal dust. Desperate for treatment, they learned the doctors had relocated to a place called _[[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]]_, a pub rumoured to be run by the Goblin Mafia. After a risky plan to tail a goblin led them to the Mafia’s hideout, Mordecai was captured and forced into negotiations. The goblins offered medical aid in exchange for the Party’s servitude, but Mordecai narrowly escaped after realizing the contract was a soul-binding trap.

Meanwhile, Halfbie and Drache infiltrated the Hunter’s Quarters, stealing supplies and weapons, while Korrigan orchestrated a diversion by planting Molotov cocktails across [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. The explosions caused chaos, allowing Halfbie and Mordecai to slip into the city beyond [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. There, they disguised themselves as nobles and encountered Chenris, who charmed a 3oblewoman for information. They learned the antimagic field emanated from the king’s palace and devised a brutal plan to infiltrate it by ambushing guards.

The session ended with the Party split: Halfbie and Mordecai prepared to execute their plan in the city, while Korrigan and Drache remained in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], armed and ready to exploit the ongoing revolt. The king’s decree of mass slaughter raised the stakes, forcing the Party to act swiftly to save their allies and dismantle the oppressive system.

# Full Session Notes
(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] woke up to their now familiar routine of a Goliath Guard barging into their tent and marching down to the depths of the mines to mine for 11 hours. The only difference this time was that much of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]) had contracted a violent cough; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan seemed fine. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s cough seems much worse than the others. Once they were free from the mines, they went down to the mess hall to get their food for the day before it was thrown away. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lull\|Lull]] gave them a knowing wink while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was deep in thought about how they could fix the magic situation, and concluded that they would need some kind of distraction or reason for leaving [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], like joining the hunters, but none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] knew of a straightforward way to join the hunters.)

(x::During their meal, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] noticed that they were all coughing and was saddened that it seemed they had caught Lung Rot so quickly. He explained that it was an infection caused by scars from soot or coal dust in the lungs. They, especially [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], were slowly dying, and if they didn’t get treatment from a doctor, it would get worse and be a painful death.)

(x:: After the meal, they decided to try heading for the doctors. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] led the way to where he remembered the doctors being located, only to find them closed and the building rotting into the ground. On the door was a message scratched in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]]. Aidan, who spoke the language, translated it to say ‘Doctors moved to [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]]’. None of them knew where this could be, so they tasked Aidan with trying to learn more about the place. However, anytime he asked about the place, most people refused to talk to him, and the only thing he learnt was that it was a pub and was most likely run by the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|Goblin]] Mafia, something he worked out from the fact that all around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] were adverts, written in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]], for joining the mafia.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they all try tailing someone who was a part of the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia to see if he would lead them to the pub. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked if that would be wise, as it would be very obvious if a group of 5 were following one [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they take turns tailing the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] while the rest stayed back, and they could then swap out at various points to keep suspicions low. They agreed this was the best plan and soon found a [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] that fit the typical archetype for the mafia and began tailing them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the first to tail them and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to the church of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] finally spotted him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] who walked around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] for a while, almost as if they were patrolling. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was soon caught, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to a wooden gate, where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] paid two platinum coins to the guard, who let him through. As the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] walked through, he spotted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but did nothing about them.)

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] all gathered to discuss what they had seen. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested waiting to see if the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] returned from the gate, and they could try to talk to them and see if they could gain entrance, and [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]] could be through that gate. They all agreed, and after an hour or 2, a group of goblins, including the one they had followed, exited and started to do the same route as the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] had before. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] motioned for the rest to hold back while they approached the group. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] told them that if they heard flute playing, that was [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s cry for help, and they should come ASAP. They all nodded, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slowly approached the group, who had gone down a nearby alleyway.)

### Mordecai’s POV  
(x::Approaching the group, they were all waiting for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had hard tailed, who stood in front and motioned for the rest to surround [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] before he asked what they wanted. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] introduced themselves with a theatrical bow and said that they wanted to talk to the mafia, as they wanted to make a deal with them. The [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] gestured to a nearby house and ordered [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to go inside. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] initially protested, but after the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] clarified that the alternative was death, he quickly gave up and went inside. They were led through the house and into a pitch-black basement where they were ordered not to turn around as a cold piece of metal was pushed against their head. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could only assume that it was a Thundergun.)

(x::The [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] ordered [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to start talking, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that he was with a [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\| group]] that could not only help them with all kinds of things, but he could also provide great entertainment with music and dance. With the goblins now sounding interested, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] continued and explained that they couldn’t now, as they and their fiends had recently contracted Lung Rot and needed a doctor.)

(x::After some back and forth, with many threats, the goblins all went upstairs to discuss. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could hear them through the basement door as they suggested that they should kill the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] now, as it would be simple and easy, until one pointed out that music was good, and they all instantly agreed. This proved to be the deciding factor as they decided to take them to the ‘boss’, who would decide what to do. When [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] heard them coming downstairs, they got back in position and went back to the door. They were about to say something as the door opened, but as the first syllable left their mouth, they were pistol-whipped and fell unconscious. )

### The Party’s POV  
(x:: After waiting near the house, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia entered. The group of goblins left quickly, holding a bag that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] joked looked very [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]-shaped before it dawned on them all that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] might be in the bag. They watched as the goblins left the alley and went through the same gate before it closed behind them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] searched the house while the other tried finding a way inside the gate. Inside the house, it was a usual place, apart from the fact that one of the rooms was full of a few large barrels. Inside are large caches of medicinal herbs, various fruits and vegetables and alcohol. Looking closer, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] realised they were all things found or produced in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]]. They grabbed a few of each and returned to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], where they showed them what they had seen. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had devised a plan where he would create a distraction to get the gear to move away from the gate so they could slip in.)

(x::Everyone agreed and watched as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] went down the road and positioned himself so that the guard couldn't quite see him before calling out to them, saying there was a fight between the slaves; however, the guard refused to leave his post. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then snuck into the house, grabbed a bottle of alcohol, and used it to start a fire, which was enough to distract the guard long enough to let [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Drache slip through the gate.)

### Mordecai’s POV  
(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] awoke in a room that looked considerably better than elsewhere in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. The room was medium-sized and filled with goblins, all brandishing weapons. In front of them was an old desk covered in paper and money, with a well-dressed [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] sitting behind it, the presumed boss of this [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|goblin mafia]] branch.)

(x::The boss started the conversation by saying his men had told him [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could become entertainment for him in exchange for a doctor. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] confirmed this, but the boss looked unimpressed. He said that while having some entertainment would be nice, the goblins were already powerful enough to do whatever they needed. They would need a lot more to convince them that they should even consider opening their ranks to a stupid non-[[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]].)

(x::Glazing over the overt racism, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they belonged to an influential group with many talents. One was great with a bow and could hunt well, another was very strong, and another was brilliant at magic and tinkering. They also explained that, unfortunately, until they all received medical attention, none of them would be of much use to them. The boss thought for a moment and said he would explain that if they agreed, they could all live here in the hunter’s quarters and the doctor would treat them, even though they were stupid non-goblins. He said that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and the bow friend would become hunters by day and performers by night. The strong man would become entertainment in a new gladiator pit, but would have to make sure to lose to any goblins. The tinkerer would help work on their weapons and make their Thunderguns more powerful. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tentatively agreed, and the boss gave a snide grin, saying that they would have an agreement if [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] would sign their contract on behalf of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] as their talent manager.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked at the contract but struggled to read it as it was written in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]]. Suddenly, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]], whose affects had been quietened by the antimagic field, spoke up. She told [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] not to sign the contract, telling them it was a soul contract for life, stating that they would have to do whatever the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia told them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if the contract could state that they would only have to do the roles mentioned earlier. The boss laughed before explaining that that would be stupid, as what if they couldn’t go hunt one day, etc. “Plus, Goblins are best and should be able say whats you dos.” the boss added.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] did not want to sign the contract, and while sitting with a quill in hand, trying to decide, they realised they could feel some of the magic returning to them. They wouldn’t be able to use much, but it would be enough to create a distraction and use a spell to make an illusion of them still in the room while they sneak out. Leaving the room, they found them, sleeves in a tavern filled with [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia members who eyed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suspiciously but did nothing to stop them. They quickly left the tavern and, in their haste, bumped into a tall [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]].)

### Mordecai, Halfbie & Drache’s POV
(x::With [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] bumping into [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], they hurriedly explained that the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia would be angry when they found out [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] escaped. They needed to leave as soon as possible. They quickly turned around to leave the hunterman quarters. Unable to see what was behind the gate, they decided just to walk through and hope the coast was clear. Walking through a large hall, a sudden hand grabbed [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]’s shoulder. It was the guard asking them where they were going. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly explained they were new to the area and were confused about where they were going. The guard, looking quite pissed, muttered something about the slave team needing to do a better job with the onboarding process before telling the group to go back inside, as they wouldn't want to be associated with the rest of the muck who work the mines. They laughed in fake agreement and went back inside. They walked until out of sight before rushing through the quarters and finding an empty building far from [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]].)

(x::With little else to do, they claimed a room, caught each other up, and got some rest. They were all awakened to explosions and frantic shouting from the guards during the night. Looking outside, many of the guards were running towards [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], many leaving their posts empty. Taking this as their chance to meet with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], they joined the rush for the gates. As they made their way to the gate, they ran past a large stone gate that was the exit from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pulled the group to the side, saying that this was the perfect opportunity to leave [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] and find the source of the antimagic field. They both agreed and decided it was best for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], the two magically inclined party members, to leave while [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] returned to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|the Korrigan]].)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was stopped by a guard near the gate, who had been ordered to stand watch. The guard told them that the hunt was off today due to a slave revolt. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that Agurd was told to go out on a hunt in case slaves escaped. The guard, too tired to complain, told [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to get their bow and do what they were told. Upon seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s confused look, I told them to get a bow from the armoury; they just had to show their tattoo and would be given one. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was still confused and left for the armoury. The conversation gave [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] a chance to slip through and escape [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. They hid in a nearby bush waiting for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to join them.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] got to the armoury, where they found [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] waiting to jump the guard running it to grab some weapons and armour. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] told the guard that they both needed weapons for a hunt. The guard asked to see their tattoos, and they explained that they had been given a regular tattoo but sent to the huntsman area. The guard muttered about how the wizards were useless and then explained that they would get the tattoos updated for them. In the meantime, he gave them a bow and armour and wrote down the lave tattoos.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used their new equipment to join [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] outside, while [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] threw it over the wall back into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], stashed it away for later, and returned to Korrigan. The choice of the expositions made it easy to slip back.)

### Korrigan’s POV
(x:: Watching his friends safely go through the gate, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] returned to the house with all the alcohol in it, grabbed as many bottles as he could, and returned to their tent. Inside, he began fashioning [Molotov Cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail). [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] helped make them. While making them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that the wooden gate went to the huntsman's quarters. After the slave revolt, they were separated from the main slave population to help prevent another one. Once all the Molotov Cocktails had been made, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] attached long fuses to them and placed them all over [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], mainly in abandoned buildings and near the wall. He wanted to create a distraction to help the other escape. Once they had all been set, he lit the fuse and returned to the tent.)

(x:: In the tent, he found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] had started to make an ointment from the medicinal herbs. She pointed at the burn marks on [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]’s arms, and he gratefully accepted the ointment, which didn’t heal anything but made the pain a lot better. They then hid everything by burning it and tried to get some rest. A little after the explosions started, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] returned and excitedly told [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] about the bow he had managed to stash away, making [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] very excited.)

### Halfbie & Mordecai’s POV
(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] were faced a decision: going left would lead to a woodland area, and going right would lead to a [[Groups & Factions/Luminara\|fancy-looking city]]. The antimagic field was coming from the city, but they would need disguises to get inside. They decided their best bet was to leave the antimagic field so they could use magic to disguise themselves and grab some clothes.)

(x::In the forest, they both used magic to clean themselves. While [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used a disguise to grab some fancy clothes, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began preparing by casting Mage Armour and Leomund’s Tiny Hut in case they needed a quick escape or a place to return to. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] soon returned with clothes, and they both put them on. Before leaving, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] cast mage armour as well.)

(x::As they approached the city, a guard questioned them about what they were doing; all of the lords were being kept in the city hall for their protection during the revolt. They said they were out on a hunting trip and were just returning. The guard respectfully congratulated them on a successful trip and apologised that it had been cut short. As they reached the city hall, it was clear to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] felt out of their depth. Inside, the panic only got worse as their hands began to shake until they suddenly stopped. They took a deep breath. There was now a different look in their eye as they looked out over the crowd, as if looking for someone in particular.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] struck up a conversation with a noble who began complaining about how much money she was losing due to the slaves, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] gave an awkward laugh. Suddenly, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] approached with a confident walk, and for a moment, it looked like there should have been a cape billowing behind them. When they spoke, it was as if they were nobles; everything about how they spoke was different and unnerving to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. Then it clicked, this was Chenris.)

(x::Chenris initiated a conversation, perfectly blending in with the people around him. Chenris and the lady spoke briefly about business and how dreadful it had been that they were losing so much money. Chenris explained that he was an investor, specifically in architecture and slavery. The noble expressed how she wanted all of the slaves slaughtered, Chenris disagreed, saying that it would take time and money to replace them all, further digging into their profits. The lady agreed but insisted that whoever was leading this had to be made an example of.)

(x::She told Chenris that she preferred to buy her slaves from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], where, coincidentally, there had been a recent uprising [1], which could prove to be a good investment opportunity. Chenris thanked them for the advice, offering them 10% of the profits made from the opportunity as thanks. He said, “You seem to know a lot about the goings on around here. I heard a rumour in the grapevine that the antimagic field tower was in need of some renovations. You wouldn’t know much about that, would you?!)

(x::The lady explained that the tower was inside the king’s palace and that their only chance to contact him would be to get an audience. Although it might be tough to get an audience, as he has an internal team for that kind of thing, at that moment, the palace doors swung open, and the king stepped forward to a balcony. Many of the nobles began to cheer.)

(x::The king gave a speech telling them that the lords were now free to return to their lives. The speech was short but incredibly insulting to all the slaves in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. Each insult was met with further insults from the crowd or a round of applause. Finally, the king explained what the punishment would be for their revolt: “I decree that one from each household shall be slaughtered to set an example of what happens when filth tries to fight back” The crowd erupted in a deafening applause as the king returned to his palace.)

(x::Chenirs and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took this as their opportunity to sneak out. They surmised that they could not get an audience with the king quickly enough before everyone was slaughtered. Chenris suggested getting some guard uniforms and entering the palace that way. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked how they would do this, to which chenris described his plan:)

(x::“First, we go to the barracks. And we can ask for bodyguards because we are worried about our safety or something similar. We then head out and take them to [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]], which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] set up to… Ice them… as the kids would say”)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was shocked at the brutality of the plan, but couldn’t think of a better way and agreed it was for the best. On the way, Chenris grabbed a cloak and threw it back to billow in the window as he walked. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could stop a laugh escaping. Approaching the barracks, a guard outside polity asked what they needed. Chenris, acting as a noble, explained that their hunting trip had been cut short due to the slaves. If they were to continue it, they would need some bodyguards. The guard jumped up and ran inside to grab some to help. He returned with two guards. Chenris made a big of a show of inspecting them before saying they would be “serviceable”. He turned on the spot and began walking to the forest.)

# Trivia & Notes
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]] rolled a Nat 1 on the constitution check for Lung Rot. Conversely, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] rolled a Nat 20. 
- Lung rot sounds very similar to [Black Lung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_lung_disease), a real disease miners used to contract due to poor safety standards and lack of PPE.
