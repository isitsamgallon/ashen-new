# Session Information
**Session Date:** 21st Sep 2025 
**Saga**: 6th Saga - Name Pending
**Attendance**: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]]

# Session Summary 
Back in the Black Tower, the party confronted the grim reality of the OFC’s finances, finding only a few thousand gold in the vaults. Discussions turned to how the fledgling nation might survive, ranging from trade diplomacy to bold piracy. Halfbie, guided by Chenris’ calculating edge, proposed an audacious plan: destroy and loot the Golden Fleet, both eliminating a threat and securing immense wealth. Though not all were convinced, the group agreed it had merit, and Viktor suggested hosting a council with the people to decide the nation’s course. In the meantime, Halfbie and Viktor pursued research into separating Halfbie from Chenris, while Mordecai arranged for his estranged father Robert to help with the military in exchange for prosthetic legs, which Halfbie eagerly crafted.

Elsewhere, Drache honoured Korrigan’s memory by tending his garden, only to encounter harpies who warned of a great evil festering in Blackwall. With just a week to root it out, their ominous words left a new weight on the party’s shoulders. Back in town, Halfbie tested the Tome of Unfinished Stories by writing that wealthy benefactors would deliver gold—and to everyone’s amazement, a parade of strange and powerful figures arrived bearing tribute. Among them were Galen Verix, the pirate-dragon Malachi, Haldir Heleyarus, and even Jub of Jub’s Tribe. The bizarre procession offered both fortune and foreboding, culminating in an unsettling confrontation with Arwyn Gryffon and his lecherous demands. Each encounter further blurred the lines between chance, divine meddling, and dangerous manipulation of reality itself.

The final visitor, Scorch Dustblood of a powerful desert family, escalated the strange gathering into violence. Enraged, Scorch attacked the party with terrifying speed and strength, cutting them down before they could mount a proper defence. The group awoke battered, their wounds tended by Steve Ulan and his healers, but all of the conjured gold was gone—save for a single mocking bag left behind. Their foray into rewriting fate had ended not with profit, but with bloodshed, warning them that meddling with powers beyond their grasp carried consequences they were ill-prepared to face.

# Full Session Notes
(x::With little else to do, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] returned to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the Black Tower]], where they discussed how they weren't comfortable with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] remaining in charge of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]], regardless of their previous events with the rebels and Ashen Cult. It was decided that it was for the best that they stayed in the nation, figured out what was happening, and sorted out as many issues as possible. Their first stop was the underground vaults to see the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]'s finances.)  

(x::Walking into the vault, they found it had around 2-3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], which was ok but not nearly enough to run a nation on. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked the accountant what their highest expenditures were. The main ones were paying soldiers and repairing areas after the rebels or [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the war for the OFC's freedom]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said they could use magic to help with the repairs, but didn't have a good plan for the soldiers. Their pay and equipment were difficult to fix.)  

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they start working on some of the plans they have come up with, as some, like becoming an entrepreneur nation, could start bringing in some [[Other Information/Money\|money]]. Halfbnie liked the ID but was unsure where they would get the [[Other Information/Money\|money]] to fund the arts—a question that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] didn't have an answer for.)  

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] pulled out a map and asked which nations [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had no evil enemies with, suggesting [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]] was a potential and untapped revenue source. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said they probably would want to work with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] after they flew into the sky and rained fireballs on their ships. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pointed to Uvam, saying they could be ok depending on the town. [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] was unknown at this point; the Dawn are so uneatable that it's hard to tell if they would trade with the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] pointed to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], stating they were probably too unstable.)  

(x::At this point, Victor noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was intently staring at the map, deep in obvious thought. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], following Victor's gaze, recognised the expression and smiled, knowing a plan was forming in [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] / [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' mind.)  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] spoke like his words were hunting for something. "What if we killed two birds with one stone?" [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was instantly interested, "[[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden fleet]] is a threat to our side as they hold a lot of trade by sea, which is a powerful resource for us. what if we destroyed [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]] and looted them for all they had?")  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that doing business with them was too expensive as they were untrustworthy, but destroying them would eliminate that issue and give them a large amount of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] to support the nation. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] commented that the fleet was a lot richer than most nations combined.)  

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] also pointed out that the fleet was doable, but the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]] would be very difficult, almost impossible. "no one has been able to take them on for Centries")  

(x::"Exactly!" exclaimed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] before quickly returning to their emo facade. Because no one has challenged them in years, their defensive skills will be even worse than their offensive skills. Plus, attacking the fleet would make the whole organisation angry at the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].")  

(x::Not everyone was convinced, but they all agreed that the plan had some merit. Regardless, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] pointed out that they should also hold a meeting to ask the nation what they wanted to do with the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]], something everyone agreed on. The delegation decided to invite everyone in the nation to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] in two days to discuss the nation's future.)  

(x::During their two days, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] spent most of their time researching and following any of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]'s leads on giving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] their body. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] walked into the library to find [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] hitting against a book, having been there for hours. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], however, was doing fine. In fact, they were enjoying themselves, as their hometown didn't have a lot of books. Whole [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wasn't hitting the books; they were using their [[Admin/Spells/Fabricate\|fabricate]] spell to help rebuild the town, explaining he soot and dirt on their clothes.)  

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had spoken to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and realised that [[[[Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] Thronwood|[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father]] would make a great candidate for leading the military and could help them get their art/ exports into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that after a rather annoying conversation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] agreed to help them with the military and would even sell their art to the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit cutters]] on the condition that they give him a new pair of legs. It was something [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hoped [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could help with, since they were good at building things.)  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was happy to build the legs and revealed they had meant to make a few bits and offered to create something that would help [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] control their magics a bit better. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] exclaimed that they would be eternally grateful for anything that would help them with this. Halbfie excitedly got to work.)  

(x::While this was happening, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went to the back of the city to find [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s old garden, hoping to keep it alive in the man's honour. He fashioned a grave for himself and then began tending to the plants in the area. He picked up a water can and watered everything, nd it seemed to instantly grow and get a lot healthier, which confused [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. Still, he assumed it was some [[Other Information/Races/Fey\|Fey]] water left over from [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]].)  

(x::He was admiring his work until he heard a strange noise from the nearby forest. Went to investigate and along a trail he came across a group of Harpies standing over the mangled corpse of another [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Divine Harpies\|Harpy]], something he knew would have been incredibly difficult to do, knowing their status as heralds of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]. he tentatively approached the situation before one called out to him.)  

(x::"You mortal," its voice boomed, " you have no business here, leave.")  

(x::One of the two on the ground next to the body spoke. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s eyes were drawn to the sound of flapping wings, discovering a group of Harpies flying above.)  

(x::"Hey..." said [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] calmly, raising his hands in a gesture to mean no [[Admin/Spells/Harm\|harm]]."I just wanted to get an idea of what's going on here. I mean, this looks awful. But I just you know we saw a [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Divine Harpies\|harpy]] flying about earlier, and they were in the middle of a fight with something, and I wonder if that's added anything to do with this.")  

(x::"You speak for a town of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]?")  

(x::"Part of a group that speaks for the town of Black Hall.")  

(x::"You hold a great evil. You bring it out, and we will vanquish it. You don't spring it out, then we will destroy you.")  

(x::"There is a great evil in Black wall?")  

(x::"Correct mortal", it croaked, "How long would it take?")  

(x::"It could take quite a while, and we don't know even where to start. I don't know what we're looking for... This could take A week if not more.")  

(x::"Good. A week. That's much better than our estimates")  

(x::"Well i did say, or more..")  

(x::"Still much better than two or three millennia!")  

(x::The [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Divine Harpies\|Harpy]] seemed unaware of how long this time frame was due to their immortality, which caused [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to explain that his race typically lived for 80 years, so he would not even get to 1 millennium to do a task. The [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Divine Harpies\|Harpy]] almost laughed, saying it was barely a blink for them before letting out a shriek that signalled the rest of the harpies to disperse and for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to leave them be.)  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] soon built the legs and a wand for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. He worked with [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] to create a pair of prosthetics made of wood and with the prestigitation spell built into them. They were programmed to make a spark every time [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] took a step, but for the first 8 hours, he was the only one not to notice.)  

(x::Roiibert howled in pain as the legs were attached and fell over immediately when he first tried to walk. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sheepishly approached his father to try and help him up, but he pushed mrod away, claiming he could do it himself. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stepped back and tried to hide his smile, watching his father fall over continuously.)  

(x::Leaning against the door, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] asked what he should get started on first and instead pointedly suggested that it would be the art. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] defensively said yes, but had no idea why that should be. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] helpfully chimmed in, explaining that running a military without capital would be difficult. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] immediately brightened to the idea and commended [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] for their smarts. While looking down their nose, they wondered why [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't be more like his friend.)  

(x::"This is for difference between you. Someone who understands the world." growled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]].)  

(x::"Hey, that's why I asked. I wanted to say it was odd to be an asshole, but I knew that people would know better. I'm using my resources because I actually accept help, " [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] retorted.)  

(x::"Hey that's not hard to know better than you")  

(x::"That and it's not that hard to walk, so fuck you")  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] interrupted the conversation by saying, "Speaking of understanding the world..." They outstretched their arm before saying, "I sure [[Admin/Spells/Wish\|wish]] that a bunch of random rich people would come and give me 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]")  

(x::There was a long pause, and everyone in the room looked at each other, half-bewildered. They gave a coy smile before opening the [[Other Information/Unique Items/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and rephrasing that event so that people actually did provide them with [[Other Information/Money\|money]]. There was an even longer pause before a knock at the door.)  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] beckoned them in, and with the open door came a blizzard of tension. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] saw out of the corner of their eye as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s attentions were grabbed; they went white with shock and fear. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' voice rang out in their head as he coyly gave Galen Verix an introduction. Before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had a chance to greet them properly, a blade was thrust into their abdomen with frightening accuracy. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] asked if they wanted him to take over, something [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was happy to oblige.)  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s demeanour shifted as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] took over. Still clutching his wound, he healed it back up and greeted the dead king properly with a bow that he meant as a sacrifice but came across as somewhat sarcastic. Galen sneered before dropping a heavy bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] in [[[[Money\|[[Money]]|[[Ch\|Ch]]enris Tallfellow ‡|[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]]]' outstretched hand. He then quickly turned to leave.)  

(x::"Uh uh ah," [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' voice rang out. Galen's face went pale for a moment before recovering, and he came swishing as he turned on his heel to face [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]. "Thank you for the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], but I believe we have some payment due for a job without a mutual friend.")  

(x::Galen dismissively said, "Right?")  

(x::"It was 1000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] each, which you're contractually obligated to hand over")  

(x::Galen stormed back into the room, rage boiling in his eyes as he handed over his dues. While this was happening, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] activated his eyes of the grave ability, something he did almost instinctively now, only to find that Galen was well and truly dead [^1].)  

(x::After handing the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] over and storming out, another knock was at the door. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] excitedly opened the door to find [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] standing in front of a long queue of people. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] bluntly stated that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] couldn't just skip the line. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to plead that he wasn't here to give [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] any [[Other Information/Money\|money]]. Still, his hopeful smile quickly faded as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] pointed out the result of their last dice game some months ago. He promptly paid up before entering the room.)  

(x::Next was a small-looking figure wearing all black armour with their face concealed beneath a hood. They nervously walked and dumped the [[Other Information/Money\|money]] in [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' hand before leaving without saying a word. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] tried to call and get their name, but they were gone.)  

(x::Next, a halfling entered the room. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] instantly recognised him as the man from his singular wooden eye and large cane. He heartily greeted [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos Goodbarrel]] by name, who answered his greeting with a confused look as he asked what he was doing here.)  

(x::"I believed you were part of a boy's machinations", [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] explained.)  

(x::"Ah, yes, either way, it's strange I fell drawn to you..." Halos' voice trailed off.)  

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] admitted he felt the same, almost a brotherly connection to the man. They both pondered in silence before [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos]] handed over the bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. The man then turned to leave. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] offered some help, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos]] was fine, as some [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|kind man]] made purple portals in the corridor to help everyone get home.)  

(x::"Indeed, anyway, I'm going through my portal now. So, Oh, I wish you well on your [[Other Information/Money\|money]]-gathering scheme. 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] is not really a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|bothe]]r for me," said Halos as he turned to leave, "Ifyou ever in the need for For a good good old chinwag And some good old halfling beer come find me in [[Locations/The Maryhollows/The Maryhollows\|the Maryhollows]].")  

(x::"I might take you up on that. Something makes me want to, you know, unleash on the necrotic energies down a weird cave system with you... strange.")  

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] pulled [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] aside to ask what the hell was happening. They were shocked as they explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wrote in the [[Other Information/Unique Items/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Tome of Unfinished Stories]] that many random rich people would give them 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. This explanation somehow left them more confused than before, but they decided to just watch and see what happened.)  

(x::The next guest arrived, but instead of knocking on the door, the wall suddenly caved in, and an ancient [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] dragon entered the room. It turned its long neck to look at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] and greeted him in a pirate accent. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] returned the greeting kindly.)  

(x::The dragon suddenly transformed into an old man with a long braided beard and pirate clothes. He pulled out a large bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] before saying, " Argg, m'hearties, here's ya 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] doubloons. Now, I think it's my turn to take what you have.")  

(x::The pirate gestured the various bags of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] around [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], with some thinking [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] convinced the pirate to wait until the end for a bigger haul. He then slipped all of the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] in a bag of his holding, aiming to swap it for the [[Other Information/Unique Items/Bag of Devouring\|bag of devouring]] later. They found a space to sit and wait as the next guest arrived.)  

(x::Next was [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] Heleyarus, who walked in with a sour-looking plaster on his face. He wasn't pleased that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], of all people, was using such a powerful relic in a quick [[Other Information/Money\|money]]-making scheme. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] blamed the whole thing on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] but explained he wasn't going to argue with the results.)  

(x::With a click of his fingers, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] created a magnetic bubble that forced everyone to manifest as the bodies they truly were. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood next to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow, a ghost apparition of [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] appeared next to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stood side-by-side. With a perfected headmaster's gaze, he questioned [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] on their actions.)  

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] saw nothing wrong with how they were using the book and pointed out that, as a researcher, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] should be well aware of the pain of trying to undo one's research and know that many would accept [[Other Information/Money\|money]] from strange places if it meant the research could continue. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]]'s eye twitched as he couldnot or would not refute the artguement, he simply truned on his heal and left the room, ending the spell.)  

(x::Next came a [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] with a large crown on his head. The [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] sauntered in and gave [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s body a look. "I believe I need to give some [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] to the top dog here." The [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] licked his lips as he continued his lustrous gaze at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]].)  

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], unaware of the man's lecherous looks, confirmed he was the 'top dog' present, outstretched his hand, and asked the man to introduce himself. The king laughed, "I see how it is. I know you're fangirling right now.")  

(x::A now confused [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stated that he did not identify as a woman and honestly had no idea who this man was. After much onside flirting, the man introduced himself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] of [[Locations/Jub’s Tribe/Jub's Tribe\|Jub's Tribe]].)  

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] eventually handed over a bag of sticky [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] plushed as he explained that he and his friend had made it to get the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] ready for them before he left. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] quickly put the bag on the floor, thanking [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] for his generous contribution.)  

(x::Next was [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek the Wise]]. The halfling was initially very against giving the group any [[Other Information/Money\|money]] and even said his book was solely based on people he knew, such as Benris, Lordakai, Bracher, Bal, and Kadan. He eventually handed over a stack of 300 copies of his book, explaining that all of his wealth was tidied up in the books. He quickly ran off, stating that every time he interacts with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], they make him do weird things.)  

(x::Next was a heavily obese half-elf, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen]] Gryffon, who froze [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] on the spot. The man hobbled with a large bucket of chicken grease and a greasy bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. He handed the coins over before turning to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], delighted that the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] remembered him. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried ot get the man to leave as soon as possible, but Arwyn had no intentions of leaving so soon.)  

(x::"I missed you so much boy, i wanna fuck you, ill make nice and rough!" he spluttered through his grease-clogged throat. He then turned ot [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] and offered to buy [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] for 9000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] on top of the regular 3000. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] quickly tourneyed him away, stating they weren't for sale. Arwyn counteroffered with 15000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], leaving [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] outraged as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] considered the offer for far too long.)  

(x::Arwyn then spotted [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] and offered 15,000 to quote, "fuck the [[Other Information/Races/Drow\|drow]]." [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] denied the offer, saying, "I know you want this [[Other Information/Races/Drow\|drow]] bussy, but that simply won't happen." Looking dejected, Arwyn began to leave the room, but not before informing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that he would eventually get the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] back; it was just a matter of time.)  

(x::Finally, a Fire Genasi entered the room and immediately pointed a blade at Victor's throat. They introduced themselves as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Scorch Dustblood\|Scorch Dustblood]], a name Victor knew well as a powerful family in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] greeted them rudely, gesturing at the sword, "Well met, friend, that'll cost you 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]].")  

(x::"We don't p,ay those games where im from", Scrooch spat.)  

(x::"Then leave", [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] spat back.)  

(x::"I am compelled to saty. Something tells me I have to put 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] in that man's hand.")  

(x::"How strange..." [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] said coyly.)  

(x::"That's all you have to do, and then you can leave", reasoned [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].)  

(x::"It doesn't say that any of you have to be alive when i leave either.")  

(x::While this happened, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly felt their hand move towards their dagger, and an outraged [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] commanded [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to kill Scorch. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to ask why, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] was so enraged by this person's presence that they could do nothing but scream in anger.)  

(x::Chneris and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to defuse the situation, but Scorch was already mad and ready to kill them all and anyone they held close. [[[[The Party\|[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]]] got ready for a fight. [[[[Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] Tallfellow ‡|[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]]] was halfway through chanting a spell when a flash of blades suddenly appeared, cutting deep into their skin hundreds of times. After that, the battle was a blur as the unprepared party was beaten one by one.)  

(x::They awoke some time later to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and many medical professionals treating their wounds as best they could. Much to [[[[Halfbie\|[[Halfbie]]]]'s dismay, the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] was all gone except for one last bag that Scorch left in [[[[The Party\|[[The Party]]]]'s unconscious bodies.)

[^1]: This confirmed a theory that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] died in a hunting accident some time ago and was being puppet by [[Groups & Factions/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]] to keep the peace. This theory is fueled by a text found in their lair in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]], [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Diary Entry Found In The Crypts of Dawnhaven\|Found Here]].
