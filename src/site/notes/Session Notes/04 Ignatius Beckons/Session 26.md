**Session Date:** 12th Dec 2024 


# Session Summary
The group stood at the edge of the crater left by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]’s destruction, struggling to process the loss of Chenris Tallfellow, who had sacrificed himself to save them. Their grief was interrupted when [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] spotted something small falling from the sky. Acting quickly, he summoned his fey companion, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]], to retrieve it. To their astonishment, the falling object turned out to be an elven figure named [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who landed screaming in terror. Despite the absurdity of their arrival, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s purple eyes marked them as Fey, igniting [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]’s curiosity and suspicion.

As they pieced together [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s fragmented memories, including visions of crashing airships and cults, the group theorized that the magical wave from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] may have linked [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s memories with Chenris’. Their journey led them to the remains of the airship [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] claimed to have been on, its shattered crystal core and faint magical residue confirming the strange circumstances of the crash. With no clear answers, the group decided to continue toward [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], where they could secure passage to the [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] to follow Chenris’ last leads.

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] faced new challenges en route, including a harrowing encounter with [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the Golden Fleet]] and eerie undead activity on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] proved their worth, showcasing magical talent while earning the group’s begrudging acceptance. Arriving on the desolate, bone-strewn island, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] found themselves in constant danger from animated skeletons. When surrounded by a horde, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast a desperate, hastened version of [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]], creating a safe haven where the group could rest and prepare for the trials ahead

# Full Session Notes
(x:: The group stand before the crater that was left by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], unable to fully grapple with the fact that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] is dead and sacrificed himself to save the rest of them. As [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] is about to turn away, he spots something small falling out of the sky. Almost by instinct, he summons [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]], his fey beast, to go up and retrieve whatever is falling. They all stand in silence as they wait for the bird to return. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] breaks the silence when he admits that he's struggling to process Chenris' death. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] echoed this sentiment but stated that no matter what, they have to push on and do what needs to be done. As [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] begins to return, the object slowly becomes clearer, and they can now make out a slender Elvin figure screaming in terror. As it gets closer, the details become clearer as they start to make out their features of green hair and fine clothing. )

(x:: The Elf's screams of terror could now be heard in full force as they slowly descended to the ground. Their screams only stopped to admire [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]]'s beautiful purple and silver feathers before quickly returning to screaming. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] roughly drops the elf to the ground before returning to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]]. As [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is giving them a hand up, the elf mentions that they recognise the group from somewhere, like in a dream or something similar. As they stand up, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|KOrrigan]] notices their purple eyes - a telltale sign of the Fey. Immediately curious, he asks them what a member of the fey is doing falling out of the sky over [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. The elf has no idea what they're talking about since they don't think they're fey. Confused about what the elf is talking about since they're clearly fey from his perspective, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] introduces himself as 'The [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'. As they reach for [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s outstretched hand, the elf has a moment of realisation, and with a smile, they shake the hand and exclaim, "Nice to meet you, Kal The [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]". [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] is visibly shaken since no one else, let alone one of the fey, calls him [[Kal †\|Kal †]] anymore and immediately starts to grill the elf, not caring about asking invasive questions and being very rude. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tries their best to calm [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] down as his questions quickly became shouting commands. )

They suddenly stand up straight as they say, "Ah! Where are my manners," as they use [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2213-prestidigitation) to clean the dirt off his clothes "My name is [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]!" as they use Prestidigitation to create sparkles around them as they give beaming smile to the group. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looks visibly jealous as the [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] s do what they like to do but with higher quality. Without a second hesitation, they do a similar thing but try to make the display of sparkles bigger and brighter. Much to the annoyance, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] just thinks this is really cool. Aidan Knight introduces himself with a simple handshake. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asks what they were doing when to cause them to start falling over [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thinks for a moment before eventually explaining, "Well, first I was in an airship that crashed, then when I opened my eyes, I was in a very dark room, then I was in a bright room, and then finally I was falling out of the sky". 

(x:: [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] starts to pace around [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], trying to get a better view and figure out who they are, not caring that this made [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] uncomfortable. Carrying on, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains that they don't know how they got here but would love to tag along with the group until they can figure out what is happening. The group agrees, but not before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] cattily says, "Oh, and I bet you want to go to a library to learn it as well" " referencing Chenri's usual solution to these sorts of problems. Without missing a beat, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains either a library or a guide will do. Looking off into the distance, they can see a small plume of black smoke rising up from behind some hills in the direction of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] says that if [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] was on an airship that crashed, then it would make sense that the black smoke might be from that. "Unless they're lying", [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] added quietly. )

(x:: As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are all getting into the carriage, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] asks [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] where they are originally from, and after a thing, they explain they are from a small island town called [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], a nation none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever adventured to or heard of. Before the carriage starts to move, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is told in no uncertain terms that they are not to touch anything, especially any old books or notes (Referring to Chenris' notes and items). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] promises they won't. It was about a half-a-day journey from what was [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], and the airship was a few hours from the town. Along the way, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asks why they don't think they're part of the fey when they have the features of one. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains that they were never brought up as fey, and neither of their parents was from the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], so they've never said they were. They also seemed unaware that their eyes were purple. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] starts to get frustrated with the whole situation as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is a complete enigma to him, he snaps out of it when Aidan pipes up, telling him to "calm down Antlers". An irritated [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] uses magic to make the journey for Aiden more difficult while the rest laugh at the funny nickname. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] begrudgingly joins Aidan in his calls for people to be nice to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], reminding [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] that they were all nice to him when he showed up after [[Kal †\|Kal †]] 's death. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] pipes down. )

(x:: Most take the travel time to get some rest and heal up. Once [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] woke up, they immediately got out a piece of paper and started to write a letter but kept the details a secret from the rest of the group. Intrigued, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] asks what he is writing, which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] says is none of their business. Turning very serious, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] explains that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] needs to be able to trust each other completely. He had already explained his secrets to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and it feels especially important now that their friend has died. He notably struggled with his emotions as he said the word friend. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs before explaining that he wants to start tying up loose ends and is writing a letter to his father. Having not heard much about [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] tentatively asks if he is on good terms with his father, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] remains tight-lipped about any details with his family. )

(x:: Suddenly, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] begins to cry as he reminisces and mentions the gecko they had met in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Mannnnnn †\|Mannnnnn †]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly figures out that [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] is probably putting his grief on the gecko instead of Chenris. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] then [Wild Shapes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) into a gecko and keeps crying as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tentatively puts him on their shoulder. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is enamoured by this ability and excitedly asks what else people can do. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] unenthusiastically says they can use magic, while Aidan says he is good at sneaking. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] says that she can also cast magic but not much else. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] interjects, saying that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]] is much more than a magic caster and is the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. She blushes slightly as she confirms this to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who thinks that's amazing and gives a polite bow that she brushes off.)

(x:: An hour after [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], they all reach the remaining frame of the airship, with parts still on fire and a shattered crystal found in the centre of the wreckage. On the walls that hadn't burnt down, the [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo could be seen, immediately raising suspicions of [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. While investigating, Aidan is able to confirm that the ship is not the same one from earlier in their adventure. Upon seeing the dead bodies, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] goes incredibly quiet as he tries to hold back his panic. They all begin to edge close ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] less so) to try and learn more from the wreckage. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] takes this time to analyse the magic around the ship and learns that there are faint traces of strange magical energy, information [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] instantly links to the large wave of magic that spread out from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] 's work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also realises that that crystal absolutely shouldn't have shattered since they're quite durable and important to keeping the airship in the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] )

(x:: Asked if their boss had the same [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo on their clothing, and they confirmed that this was the case and had vague memories of the university but wasn't sure when asked if he knew who [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] was. They explained that they were on the airship because they were on some kind of expedition to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], but they weren't sure what the expedition was for. )

(x:: Looking at the airship in more detail, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] starts to remember weird visions of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|cults]] and needing to save people. Once hearing this, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] immediately comes up with a theory that maybe the crystal chatting from the magic of magic wave could have caused Chenris' and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's memories to somehow fuse together, explaining the weird pockets of knowledge they have. Throughout this whole process, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is notably hesitant to call Chenris by name, referring to them as 'you know' or 'the old man'. With little to garner from the wreckage, they decided to head back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]] since it was getting late. Before getting back into his carriage, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] took one last good luck at the scene, but more importantly, he was also looking for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] had some questions for the man, and he was angry he hadn't gotten them already. )

(x:: When heading back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] tried to plan what to do next, but the decision eventually broke down as neither [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nor [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] could decide as they kept thinking about how Chenris would have loved to go to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and if he couldn't go then what was the point? Eventually, they decided to go to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] since that's where all clues were leading, so they felt obligated to go. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to cut the tension by saying, "If it helps, I would also find [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] fascinating", with a smile, it was not well received, with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] even mocking them. Still feeling quite hot-headed, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] snarkily asked what they could even do. Not to be deterred, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly explains that they love magic, researching and tinkering with things. Upon hearing these, they begrudgingly invite [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] to join them until they can figure out what is going on. Before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] could accept, they heard a voice speak in their head, telling them to join the group. They immediately start looking around to try and find the source of the voice but failed to do so, and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] makes a comment on how they look like they're on drugs. )

(x:: They all decided that their best bet would be to go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]] and hire a boat to cross the waters to the island. There was briefly a discussion to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], who could probably just teleport them there, but it was deemed too much of a risk to make the long journey back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to find he couldn't. )

(x:: Thirty minutes into the journey, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] decided to test [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] further by speaking in Sylvan, the language of the fey, to see if they would respond to him. To his surprise, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had no idea what [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] was saying, asking them to speak in common. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] was bewildered, screaming, "HOW DOES A FEY NOT SPEAK SYLVAN?!?". He was so shocked he had to inspect [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] further to confirm their fey status and confirmed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was, in fact, Eldarin - definitely a fey specifies. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] starts to cycle through all of his known languages to see what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would respond to. He first tried Primordial to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responded confused, asking why they were now speaking Primordial, noting it felt like they were excluding the rest of the group. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] ignored him and carried on his test and learnt that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew all the same languages as Chenris. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] surmised that the big tell would be to get them to respond to Ancient Dwarven so they asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] for something and she flatly said "something" in Ancient Dwarven. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responds in kind, still very confused but putting further credence to their theory that [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and chenris' memories must have merged. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs deeply and absent-mindedly questions "Why would [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|she]] do this??")

(x:: They stopped to rest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]]; everyone flashed their [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] tattoos at the front desk to gain entry until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed he didn't have any such tattoo. The receptionist flatly tells them that the fee is 50 [[Gold\|Gold]] - Money [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] did not have. Aidan and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] offered to pay the fee, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] thanked them deeply and offered up the three pieces of [[gold\|gold]] he owned for the payment. With the fee paid, they all get a good night's sleep. The next morning, while eating breakfast, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] gathers everyone but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] for a huddle ([[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] doesn't notice at all), and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] states that there are a lot of parallels between chenris and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and they should test him by making him do the directions. They call [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and ask if they could navigate them to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]]. When he asked, he suddenly remembered that he was mapping when the purple light hit and caused the ship to crash. He explained his hesitation but eventually said they'd, do it. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] navigates the next leg of their journey perfectly causing most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] a lot of confusion.)

(x:: Arriving at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], they are confronted with a small fishing village comprised mostly of hearty sailors, and the stench of fresh fish clouds the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] approaches. The person they deem to have the best vibe and strikes up a conversation. It's an incredibly gruff sailor who greets them well enough. Getting straight to the point, they ask if the sailor could take them to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]], he says he can, but it would cost them. The sailor says that it's a long journey, plus they would need a return trip, and he would need to get supplies. All in, it would cost them 1000 [[Gold\|Gold]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to haggle the price when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] stepped up and offered to pay the fee, handing over 100 Platinum to the sailor. She explained that she was feeling quite bad for not helping out as much, and it was the least she could do for the people who have been so good to her. They all thank her, and the sailor points to his boat, a smaller wooden ship that doesn't even have an inside or lower deck, but there was enough space for some bed rolls and to eat.)

(x:: After travelling for most of the day at sea, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] see a huge ship with golden sales, most likely part of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]]. The sailor explained that if they managed to board, then they would most likely take all their money and kidnap [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] as a slave. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] quickly casts the [Gust of Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-gust-of-wind?srsltid=AfmBOorwXJ5zKU-E1NM_z-xkyOugDjkUXDfjqbrLN6fJRNdLAN0WsWXv) spell into the sale to make the boat go as fast as possible. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] if they would be able to call a whale to come and toe their boat so they could get away. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] tries his best but completely messes up the call; he does so so bad that he might have even scared most of them off. The larger boat starts to close in on them and is about 1000 ft away. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] spots some icebergs off in the distance that they could use to escape the fleet; he falsely assumes that their smaller boat would be quick enough to reach the icebergs in time. The large ship catches up quicker than expected and suddenly shoots a large metal claw onto the boat. It latches on through large wood splinters everywhere, damaging the boat. The large boat was about 40 feet away from them now. )

(x:: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] decided to burn the rope with their magic while [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] attempted to hide [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]], it wasn't very good since there weren't many places to hide on their small boat. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uses minor illusions to hide the flames on the rope so that if any tried to slide down it, they would be burnt or fall into the ocean.  [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] uses his bow to cast a large [[[Lightning Bolt\|[Lightning Bolt]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt?srsltid=AfmBOopYOAMOiwlColBdpBSjbi8_9qxrM2Kq7jLYgB0ScN5y8O4ch0CK) to tear through the large ship's sails, shredding the first one completely and damaging other parts of the boat. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] casts [Fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball), mentioning it is time for a 'cleansing flame ', and manages to destroy the middle mast/ sail. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gets excited after seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s Fireball and tells them that they can do the same. With that, they cast Fly on themselves and flew up over the ship and threw their own fireball at the wheel and sails near it, damaging the ship's captain and crew. In a truly mental moment, the captain continues to bark orders at their crew as the ship begins to turn to fire their canons at the boat. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] quickly casts [Fog Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618910-fog-cloud) on the canons to stop most of them from being able to aim properly. )

Seeing their chance, they race off for the Iceberg and manage to get beyond one before it explodes due to canon fire. The sailor begins to bark orders at them, shouting if they don't help, then they are all as good as dead. Working together, the boat is controlled well, and they manage to escape the big boat. Aidan makes sure everything is good, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] make sure all the ropes are tied down and the sales are working well, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] works on watching the big ship so they aren't hit. After a while, the large boat was out of sight, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was safe for now.

(x:: Sailing further, the fog began to get thicker and thicker until they weren't able to see their hand outstretched from their body. After another few minutes of travel, they finally made land at [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly gets off the ship and exclaims that it is good to make land again. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is less than impressed and quite jealous of the fact that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was also able to cast fireball and even fly and was quite mean with the Eldarin, going as far as calling them 'Halfwit'. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] helps the sailor fix his boat while [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] attempts to teach [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] how to speak whale. Warning the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] that the sound for 'Hallo' is very similar to 'Fuck ya mum', and said to not mix it up. Venturing further inland, the island is covered in dense fog and a thick layer of snow. All of the plant life was long dead, and disturbingly, when walking on the snow, it wasn't always the familiar sound of snow crunching but the sounds of snapping bones. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] wiped away some of the snow to find the ground was covered in thousands of [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]] bones. He quickly covered the bones back up before catching up with the rest. )

(x:: They eventually came to the base of an incredibly steep cliff. Assuming it was getting quite late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it was best to set up camp. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] Explains they know a spell called [Leomund's Tiny Hut](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619013-leomunds-tiny-hut?srsltid=AfmBOoqJMYdbYLPzabTVA7hfhzPn71M0bwusr-38IMP5-1Qa9P8SME5c) that could keep them safe behind an impenetrable forcefield. While they began the ritual to summon this spell, the rest gathered firewood, and before long, they were safe and warm. Throughout the night, some weird moaning can be heard; it sounds like undead, and they are quite close. Some people were able to see a few skeletons, but not much could be seen due to the fog. Waking up the next day, none of the skeletons could be found, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] theorised that the bones could animate during the night and create the undead skeletons. What could cause this? They had no idea. Checking the bones, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] found some magical residue on the bones but whatever magic was used had faded quite considerably.)

(x:: They decided to push on. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] immediately started to try and climb the cliff face, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] suggested that there would probably be a path up the mountain if they walked around. Walking around the mountain they find a large stone archway with runes written on it and a path going up the mountain, although it was quite steep and windy. Investigating the runes carefully [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] discovered they were Ancient Draconic and translated them to say "The resting place of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]], may this fortress stand strong")

(x:: They carry on up the mountain. Before they can make it too far, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] confesses that she is not built for the extreme cold and wouldn't be much help to them and says she'll wait for them at the boat. Concerned about the Skeletons, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggests that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] uses the [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) spell on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]]. The spell gives her one reply that she could use as a distress call. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] begrudgingly admits that this is a good idea and does just that. They watch as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] disappears into the snow before carrying on up the mountain. As they progress up the mountain, they begin to really struggle with the cold. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] offers them his cloak for extra warmth, which seems to really help them.)

(x:: Eventually, they reached a clearing when suddenly [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] began to hear the undead's moans again, but this time, there seemed to be a lot, and they were coming this way. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] hurriedly explains that Leomund's Tiny Hut normally takes about 10 minutes to cast due to its complexity. But they have a way to make it take about a minute. With the sounds of skeletons coming from all sides, they have little choice but to surround [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and protect them while they perform the sped-up ritual. First, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] casts his healing spirit centred on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and summoned the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] then used their meta-magic to carefully cast [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2058-darkness) so enemies would find it much more difficult to hit them if they got close but wouldn't affect them. Suddenly, Skeletons appeared out of the fog and began to attack them, but with the aid of the set-up and the use of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s Area-of-affect attack, they were easily able to defend themselves against the oncoming hoard of enemies. Then, as they said it would, after a minute, Leomund's Tiny Hut sprung into existence, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] collapsed out of exhaustion from the immense amount of focus the act required. The rest of them decided to also get some rest while they were safe within the confines of the spell.)
