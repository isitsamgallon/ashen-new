# Session Summary 
The session opened with Drache and Viktor rushing into the forest after hearing explosions, quickly finding Halfbie and Mordecai exhausted, scorched, and standing in a circle of melted snow. Once the chaotic fight with the undead hunters was recounted, Drache briefed them on Ringo the Hunter’s offer to guide the group safely through the perilous woods toward the Golden Fort. Upon returning to Snowport, the party endured bickering, a magically weaponised snowball fight, and the strange local customs of a tavern with no rooms—before sitting down with Ringo to finalise the agreement. His knowledge of the cursed hunters intrigued Halfbie, who eagerly questioned how to properly kill the undead. That evening, after Mordecai confessed the deer-hunting fiasco, Ringo provided deer meat to ensure the party could complete their task for Halo’s Emporium, leading to a late-night cooking session, a fortified stew, and Halfbie’s ecstatic purchase of _Silence_ and _Pass Without Trace_ scrolls.

The next morning brought an unexpected blow to Halfbie’s confidence. As they scribbled complex magical formulae into their spellbook, Ringo—a non-wizard—casually pointed out a fundamental error in their calculations, leaving both Halfbie and Chenris internally shaken. Still, the group packed up and set off toward the Golden Fort, with Ringo insisting they obey every one of his commands without hesitation. Mordecai glared pointedly at Halfbie, who sheepishly promised to “try.” As they trekked through the snowy forest, Ringo halted abruptly and commanded them to hide. Only Drache, Aiden, and Mordecai managed it; Halfbie and Viktor stood awkwardly in the open clutching branches like improvised camouflage, immediately spotted by a group of cursed hunters and an enormous, club-wielding giant.

Combat erupted as the undead hunters vanished into invisibility, leaving the party to focus their magic on empowering Drache for a clash with the towering brute. Viktor and Halfbie were quickly targeted, Ringo struggled to break free of encirclement, and the cursed hunters stalked unseen through the blizzard-swept clearing. The session ended mid-battle.

# Full Session Notes
(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began leaving the room to find the others; the explosions [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was hearing in the distance were almost definitely from the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Opening the creaky wooden door, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly found the frantic [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]. When [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] saw [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] jumped at him, leaving the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]] to catch [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], something [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had become surprisingly adept at with other members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Once [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was safely put down from [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s princess carry, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained what [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had been up to, and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]'s offered to safely take [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] through the woods. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] agreed that this was a great opportunity, but they should check on the other.)

(x::The distant explosions made [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] fearing for the worse as he activated his spell, Thunderstep. Suddenly, the smell of ozone filled the room, and arcs of lightning stretched out into his surroundings. Without explanation, he grabbed [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and began teleporting out into the woods towards their [[Admin/Spells/Friends\|friends]]. Upon arriving, they found [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] standing in a clearing of melted snow, hanged over and struggling to catch their breath. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked fine apart from some bruising and cuts, while [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] was covered in burns and scar tissue. They were bleeding from multiple places, but mainly seemed fine.)

(x::After a brief explanation of how they got to be as they were, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] informed the last remaining members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's offer. Both of them thought it was a great idea. So they started making their way back down. Victor used Thunderstep to reach the Tavern quickly so he could get warm and eat a little. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began fighting in a way that reminded [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] of two kids fighting, with one accusing the other of something and the other retorting with mockery.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] spent most of the time highlighting how dangerous it was for them to walk into the forest, and they should've run when the Snowballs were being thrown with deadly intent. [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], for their part, agreed that it was dangerous and very reckless; however, they didn't care and better yet, they learned something new.)

(x::Before [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] left, he and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] analysed the scene. They theorised that these hunters were suffering from a form of blood curse that a tribe is usually cursed with, which was how they had returned to life. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] remarked that it was most likely a very similar curse to one afflicting the Elven Caniaballs.)

(x::Walking back to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] took some time as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] got into a vicious snowball fight, which became very one-sided when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] realised that their cloak could be used to melt the snowballs before they could hit them. What they didn't think of was all of the water that would now be falling on them from the melted snow. The whole ordeal made [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] howl with laughter as an embarrassed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stormed ahead.)

(x::Eventually, they made it back to the Tavern, and upon seeing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] return, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] pulled a chair up to an empty table and gestured for the rest ot join him. As they walked over, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used their magics to clean themselves up and make themselves look a bit more presentable. At the same time, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went to the bar to grab them both a beer.)

(x::As [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  watched them all clean themselves off, he whispered, "Bloody foreigners" under his breath, something that all but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] heard. None addressed it, caring more about hearing the man out rather than his boring racism. He began making his case as they sat down. They all agreed it was a fair deal, especially since we knew about the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]]. He confirmed this, but stressed that he would not engage with the raid itself and would try his best to help with some of the planning. He admitted that he only worked as a guard for the front gates that opened for the boats, so the inner workings of other parts of the fort weren't very well known to him.)

(x::They cheered their drinks to confirm the deal before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] mentioned that, before heading off, it would be good for them to get some sleep and rest up after their fight with the zombies in the forests. At hearing this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's ears pricked up.)

(x::"Zombies? decribe 'em for me." he barked.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took their time to explain the encounter they had earlier. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  explained that they were a known entity, most likely cursed a long time ago. Many Hunters in the area had become quite good at fighting back and even learnt how to kill them most effectively. It was now [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s turn to become interested, as they enquired as to how to kill them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  explained that if you killed/ damaged their bodies enough, then soon they wouldn't get up again, and they would stay down.)

(x::"Still..." [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] pondered, "Strange to see them come so close to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]..." His thoughts trailed off as he rubbed his chin.)

(x::While he stewed, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] approached the bartender to ask if he had any rooms available for the night. The bartender was confused and asked why he would have rooms for rent. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to explain that many taverns offered rooms for rent to tourists. Their voice trailing off as they realised how strange a nation [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] must be to have tourism. Sighing deeply, the bartender said that they were more than welcome to sleep on the floor if they wanted somewhere warm to stay for the night. Having slept in worse [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions\|conditions]], they both happily accepted and returned to the group.)

(x::Sitting back down, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] asked if, before they left, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  could help them hunt down two deer to give to the shopkeeper at Halo's emporium. Upon mentioning the incident, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|mordecai]] could no longer look [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] in the eye out of shame. After some prodding, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained the situation to the group, leaving [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] trying his best not to laugh.)

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]], seeing that this would stop them from leaving as soon as possible, stood up, placed large hunks of meat on the table, and said they could have it if they went first in the morning. When asked if the beef was dear, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  just shrugged, saying "sure".)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], desperate to make it up to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], offered to help with the cooking; however, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] suggested that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] should be the one to cook, with him being so good at it. And once the barkeeper gave his permission to use the kitchens, they began to cook a stew with the deer. With [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] helping to control the flames, the meal was coming along very well. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] popped in to check on them, holding a glass of expensive wine which had apparently taken their fancy.)

(x::"Gee Halbie, you're really pulling out all the stops for this, thanks." said [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] as he grabbed the glass and poured the contents into the stew to fortify the stock. With his back to [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], he didn't realise how saddened this made [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who was really looking forward to enjoying the glass.)

(x::However, soon the stewed deer was finished, its beefy aromas filling the air around them. It was now extremely late, so [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], using their [[Admin/Spells/Mage Hand\|mage hand]], picked up the pot and dashed out the door, thanking [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] for all of his hard work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly made their way to the Halo emporium. They knocked on the door, watching a small candlelight flicker through the house to the door.)

(x::The [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], nursing a deep yawn, asked if he could help them. They both presented the stew, and, as promised, he offered them a 50% discount on their purchases. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly ordered a Silence and a Pass With Trace spell scrolls. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] handed over the [[Other Information/Money\|money]] and barely managed to keep their excitement in check as the Halfling went back to bed. Getting back, they all quickly crashed as they lay on the floor in a quieter tavern. Tango sat guarding them, his crossbow serving as a leaful warning to any still drinking in the Tavern.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awoke earlier than usual, like a child on Christmas Day. They were simply unable to contain their excitement for their new scrolls. They grabbed their spellbook and opened it at the table [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  sat at and began their calculations. Between furious scriblings of [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s summoned quill, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  looked at [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and asked them to explain what they were doing and how it worked.)

(x::The words practically vomited out of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s mouth and began explaining the intricacies of how magic worked. Their elaborate explanations on how the maths of magic were calculated were just loud enough to tire the other members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], who looked at one another, chuckling about how much theory was involved in something that came to them naturally. They soon went about their day, not seeing any point in going back to bed.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s explanation was cut short as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  pointed at one of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s long calculations and simply pointed out an error to them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s whole existence shook for a moment as they looked down and immediately spotted a mistake. It was a fundamental mistake that only a novice would make, which only seemed to worsen the situation.)

(x::Although not sharing their thoughts with one another, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] both wondered how someone without formal magic training was able to instantly spot a mistake. Although it was basic to them, it was the equivalent of someone hearing a language for the first time and instantly figuring out how to translate.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], cauatioly thanked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  for pointing out their mistake before continuing to write the new spells into their book. Once everything was ready, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] packed their things and began to head out for the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  guided them through the forest. Before leaving, he insisted that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] obey every order he gave without question. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] shot a point glare at [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who, for their party, sheeishly said they would do their best to curb their curiosity. After the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] said yes, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  sighed, knowing this would be the best he was going to get.)

(x::Walking through a large clearing in the snowy forest, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  suddenly stopped, signalling to the rest of he party to do the same. He suddenly "Get down!" before hiding away in the snow and foliage. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and Aiden followed suit. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], however, panicked and were unable to hide themselves properly. Both grabbed branches that were likely covered their hands in an attempt to blend in. It didn't work.)

(x::Suddenly, a short snowstorm blew through the clearing, leaving behind 7 figures. 6 of them looked exactly like the cursed hunters, while the last was an unintelligent giant holding a club as long as [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] was tall. The cursed hunters immediately spotted [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] 'hiding'. The cursed hunter just stared for a while, awkwardly unsure of how to proceed in this situation. Hlafbie and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] stood stock-still for a few minutes before [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was the first to break. He tried to reason with them, but before he could say more than a few words, all but the giant had disappeared.)

(x::### Combat encounter)

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] fought the cursed hunters and the giant. With all the cursed hunters invisible, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] focused on the giant, buffing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to increasingly high levels with spells like [[Admin/Spells/Haste\|Haste]] and Enlarge/Reduce. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  tried his best to gain some distance but kept getting surrounded by the cursed hunters.)

(x::**This session ended halfway through combat because it was getting late. **)
