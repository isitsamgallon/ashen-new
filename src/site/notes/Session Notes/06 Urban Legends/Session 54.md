# Session Information
**Session Date:** 21st Dec 2025 
**Saga**: 7th Saga - Winter Warriors
**Attendance**: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]]

# Session Summary 
The session was defined by a brutal, near-fatal ambush in the frozen forest as the party faced the cursed hunters and their giant enforcer. The battlefield fractured instantly: Mordecai stalled the giant with subtle magic, Drache was locked in desperate melee with invisible stalkers, Viktor fought for his life against overwhelming odds, and Aidan and Ringo were forced into constant motion. Halfbie remained hidden, directing the fight through their manifest mind and Eldritch Cannon. Despite clever tactics—Ringo felling a hunter permanently and Mordecai forcing the giant to retreat—the party was steadily overwhelmed. Viktor fell first, and desperation mounted as the hunters closed in and the giant returned to the fray.

At the breaking point, Chenris seized control of Halfbie and unleashed devastating fireballs directly into the melee. The explosions obliterated several stalkers and stalled their unnatural resurrections—but at enormous risk, nearly killing Drache outright. Healing magic pulled Viktor back from death, only for him to be cut down again moments later. One by one, the party collapsed under the relentless assault until only Aidan remained standing. In a final reversal, Halfbie reclaimed control and unleashed powerful restorative magic, reviving Viktor and Mordecai, who in turn flooded the battlefield with healing. Renewed, the party crushed the remaining resistance: the stalkers fled for good, and Drache personally tore the giant down in a cathartic, brutal finish.

In the aftermath, tensions flared. Viktor confronted Halfbie over the fireballs, quickly realising Chenris had intervened, though the party chose to let the matter lie—for now. Examination of the fallen hunters revealed unusual arrows made from “Hunter’s metal,” raising suspicions about the influence and secrecy of Ringo’s people. That night, the group camped beneath Leomund’s Tiny Hut, sharing warmth, wary conversation, and deeply questionable meat that Ringo insisted was venison despite smelling—and tasting—like beef. With Blackwall still unstable and the Hunter Society looming as an unknown power, the party rested uneasily, knowing they had survived only by the thinnest of margins.

# Full Session Notes
(x::The battle fractured into a symphony of chaos. Three desperate fights unfolded simultaneously: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood alone before the hulking giant. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s battle axe wove a desperate perimeter against two stalking shadows. At the same time, across the field, Aidan and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] danced with a pair of their own. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], beset by three, fought for each breath. From behind the gnarled bark of a snow-covered tree, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] watched, their physical form hidden as their manifest mind and Eldritch Cannon extended their will into the fray.)

(x::Seizing a moment, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] broke away, and Aidan vanished into a distraction. Their two assailants, now without prey, turned their icy blades on [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], cutting him down. The sight was a trigger. With a roar that ignored all tactical sense, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] charged to his ally's defence, weathering two brutal strikes meant to stop him. The stalkers swarmed, encircling the doctor and the barbarian in a tightening ring of steel.)

(x::While his companions drowned in the tide, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wielded a subtler weapon. A whispered *[[Admin/Spells/Suggestion\|Suggestion]]* slithered into the giant's mind. The massive creature blinked, its club slipping from numb fingers to thud against the earth. Unopposed, it began a slow, ponderous retreat. From behind the tree, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s cannon [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|spat a]] pulse of [[Admin/Spells/Mending\|mending]] energy toward [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], even as their magic lashed the stalkers. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]]'s shot whistled through the air, felling a stalker, and it stayed down. No unnatural reanimation. A clue, lost in the desperation.)

(x::It was not enough. The onslaught was a hammer, and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] fell, his breath stilling. High above, through the eyes of their spectral self, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] watched. Their body, disguised with twigs and leaves, sat motionless, a spellbook on their lap. Their eyes narrowed, their voice now a blade of ice. "When such an elegant solution appears before you," [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] muttered, "one would be a fool not to take notice.")

(x::The very air screamed in protest. A fierce, orange glow drowned the battlefield as a sphere of primordial fire bloomed above the fray. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had only a moment to look up in dismay before it crashed down upon him, a sun made wrath. The explosion engulfed him and the stalkers that hemmed him in. The giant whirled, its retreat forgotten at the sight of its slowly resurrecting, burning friends. Rage reignited; it charged [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], who danced aside by a hair's breadth.)

(x::Singed, smoking, but burning with a fury that matched the flames, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] fought on, his axe a wild, roaring arc. From their sanctuary, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] watched the chaos her fire had sown, a smirk touching his lips. "**[[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|Luire-Sonosin]]**," he whispered. And the battlefield exploded a second time. Another [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] tore the heart from the battlefield, a shockwave of blistering heat scattering bodies and hope alike. The stalkers around [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] were cinders, their resurrections slowing to a crawl. But [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s fury now had a new target: the tree, and the ally who had made him collateral. He was a breath from charging when a wave of cool, healing energy washed over him, a merciful gift to say sorry.)

(x::The healing had done its primary work: [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]'s eyes snapped open with a ragged gasp. But life was a fleeting gift. A stalker was there in an instant, plunging a blade of spectral ice into his chest, silencing him once more.)

(x::The tide began to turn, but at a grisly price. Stalkers fell, their unnatural animation finally spent, but they dragged [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and then [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] back into darkness with them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] were next, shattered by the giant's returning club. Silence, thick and heavy, fell, broken only by the ragged breaths of Aidan. He stood alone, blade trembling but raised, against a giant and figures who refused to die.)

(x::Behind the tree, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s physical eyes opened. Their mind's eye surveyed the carnage, the bloodied forms of their [[Admin/Spells/Friends\|friends]] strewn like broken dolls. "Now this simply won't do," they chimed, a strange lightness in the void.)

(x::Their manifest mind glided to [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]. A sparkle of golden light, liquid and warm, flowed over the doctor's still form. He gasped, life rushing back in. His bleary eyes caught a similar, smaller explosion of healing light by [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], who stirred, clawing back to consciousness. Standing, bloodied but unbowed, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] raised a hand, his voice a resonant chant. "**[[Mass Cure Wounds\|Te’-Sorwyn]]**." The words unleashed a wave of healing energy that washed over the battlefield, pulling each companion, gasping, from the brink back into the fight.)

(x::Renewed, they were a storm. The remaining stalkers, seeing their comrades truly fallen, broke and fled. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] ignored them entirely. His world had narrowed to the giant. He was upon it, a whirlwind of vengeful steel, each blow a thunderclap of pain that tore a scream from the beast. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] sent Magic Missiles sailing after the fleeing stalkers, but their power was spent. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]]'s focus, their unified wrath, was now a lance aimed at a single heart. Under their combined assault, the giant could not stand. It wavered, roared its final defiance, and fell, shaking the earth one last time.)

(x::They all stood around their giant's body, their breath visible against the sheer cold of the battlefield. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] slammed their book shut and rushed to join their party. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was upon them in an instant with the power of his [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]], materialising in front of the boy with shadows that fell like leaves in the autumn. His face was a mask of rage, and he demanded to know what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was thinking during the fight.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s head cocked like a pup trying to understand an alien concept, and they said they were wondering whether they wanted stew or soup for dinner. Victor's eyes blinked in shock before realising [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] had most likely taken over, as exploding a [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] above their comrades was much too clinical a move for [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] let them off the hook, but still exchanged annoyed glances amongst themselves. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] beckoned the boy over to the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|corpses]] to analyse it. One of them still had the arrow that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] had shot into it. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] pulled it out and, after a brief inspection, found nothing out of the ordinary apart from the metal being much shinier than he would expect from the typical Iron used arrows. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also couldn't come up with anything new, so they joined [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]], who had constructed a campfire to help warm everyone up.)

(x::Sitting down cross-legged, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to chant and, after a few minutes, summoned Leomand's Tiny Hut. The forcefield instantly surrounded them, helping capture the heat. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] was astounded and commented that he had never experienced such luxury. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] smiled, " We like to treat our workers well", before lying down and reading their book.)

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]], for his part, retrieved the meat that smelled suspiciously like steak from his patch and began to grill it. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took the meat prematurely and started eating it. It was essentially a raw meeting, and when questioned, he said he likes his meat rare.)

(x::Between mouthfuls of raw meat, he asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] about the arrow he pulled from [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|the deathless clan]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] was incredibly cagey about the details, simply stating that it was 'Hunter's metal' and that only members of [[Groups & Factions/The Hunter's Society\|the Hunter's society]] could get them.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] used the sending spell to contact [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. The spell allowed him to send a [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] of 25 words or fewer to anyone he was familiar with. His [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] was "How is the situation in Blackwell at the moment? Can you give us an update?")

(x::[[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] soon replied with "Rebels in the forest, people dispacted, everything ok otherwise")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] nodded and signalled for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to set up private communication with the other members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. He explained that he was fearful that, if the hunter society was the only group capable of making arrows that could kill [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|the deathless clan]], it must mean they had tremendous influence in the region. Everyone agreed it would be a good idea to keep an eye on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] and learn more about the situation.)

(x::Looking at the suspicious meat, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked, "This is nothing against your cooking. Why does it smell like beef? Didn't you say it was venison?")

(x::"Correct, it doesn't really matter though, meat's meat", he gruffly responded, getting irritated by the question.)

(x::"I'll eat it. Does it taste like beef?" asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], to which the Hunter nodded his head.)

(x::"Why not just call it beef?")

(x::The Hunter shrugged and grabbed a piece, and took a large bite.)

(x::Before taking a bite, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quietly cast [[Admin/Spells/Bless\|Bless]] on himself, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and checked if it was poisoned. The food wasn't poisoned, but his blessing helped the food go down without anything happening, unbeknownst to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]].)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was about to take another bite before asking [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] if this was [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]] meat, and they weren't bein' cannibals by eatin' it. The question filled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] with rage as he screamed, "the fuck you think i am?!")

(x::"[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] that isn't very nice", chimed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] apologised and took another piece of meat before they turned in for the night.)
