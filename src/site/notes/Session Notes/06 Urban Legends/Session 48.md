# Session Information
**Session Date:** 13th Sep 2025 
**Saga**: 6th Saga - Urban Legends
**Attendance**: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Jae Knight\|Jae Knight]]

# Session Summary 
The session opened with Halfbie reuniting with the party in Blackwall, sporting a new winter Eladrin look and a far darker outlook. Their grief and frustration poured out in sardonic quips, shocking Viktor, who attempted to counsel them. During the exchange, Halfbie revealed they had once “birthed a god,” namely Vaelrith, a revelation that sent Viktor spiralling into panic. His confession about using stolen divine energy only deepened the tension, especially when Mordecai admitted he had consulted Seifer to drive the rebels away. Through these exchanges, the party found themselves confronting uncomfortable truths about gods, possessions, and the blurred line between mortal and divine influence.

Halfbie’s inner turmoil worsened when they admitted seeing not themselves but three other faces—two gods and a dead man—whenever they looked in a mirror. This led to Chenris briefly taking control, revealing that neither he nor Halfbie were the true owners of the body but rather pawns of a goddess’s manipulation. Viktor tried proposing magical solutions, but Chenris dismissed them coldly, criticising Viktor’s magic before relinquishing control back to a shaken Halfbie. The group attempted to steady themselves by shifting focus, deciding to infiltrate the rebel base in search of answers. Diplomacy, however, unraveled swiftly when the leader revealed ties to Ehobel and Empress Obeus Yelris, before exposing his true allegiance to the Ashen Cult and detonating in a devastating explosion.

Barely escaping the collapsing building, the party regrouped on the streets, wounded and reeling. Mordecai, urged on by Seifer’s whispers, unleashed fiery wings and immolated all the surviving rebels—though in his mind, they simply fled unharmed. The others, horrified, were silenced by Seifer’s psychic command never to reveal what truly happened. The session closed on a note of dread and division, with Mordecai insisting Seifer had left the Ashen Cult, Halfbie openly doubting him, and Seifer herself promising that her true motives would be revealed later in the desert. The party, unsure who or what to trust, were left with more questions than answers.

# Full Session Notes
(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] stood motionless, still in battle formation, surrounded by the bodies of the defeated rebels. They all collectively jumped out of their skin as the doors to the councillor's room magically flung open. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] sauntered into the room, their freshly cut hair to cause it to fringe over their face and cover one of their eyes. Their hair was dip dyed black, with their natural hair turning a stark icy blue, indicative of a winter [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]].)

(x::They quickly joined their friends, and in a glum tone that was a jagged contrast to their usual happy and airy voice, they asked if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had been up to anything interesting while investigating the [[Locations/Ancient Dwarven Tomb\|Ancient Dwarven Tomb]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] abruptly stated that they had been up to things here and there before quickly questioning them on their new look.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], looking through their fringe, stated, "Life is bad. I'm mourning and suddenly realised I knew how to dye my hair.")

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suddenly remembered that he had accidentally caught [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] dying his hair, his typical silver one, on his typical one evening because he, quote, 'Was born in the wrong generation and wanted his hair to match his internal image of himself.')

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] continued to explain that they had all lost a great man. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] innocently stated that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], by all accounts, was a great man, which got him a glare from [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mumbled something about wanting to learn guitar. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] offers to teach them the instrument, but before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] can respond, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] puts a caring hand on their shoulder and asks, "Would you like to talk about it? We could talk about your feelings. What is this doing to your senses? I admit I'm better at the physical part of doctoring, but I want to be better at this bit as well")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] lets out a deep sigh as if talking to a clueless grandparent about something infinitely simple to them, like a new spell or machinery. "well, nothing matters and the world is... crap.")

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] all shot each other a worried glance. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was saddened to see the final innocent party member finally lost. While [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] muttered, "Oh shit, he's seen reality, fuck")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] tried to comfort [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] by saying, "Hey, in this world, there are terrible people and chaos. But the one thing you can control is how you react to it, how you deal with it, how you tell everyone to essentially back off. You find the few good people, like your friends here." Notably, only referring to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] caused [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to realise that they weren't wrong.)

(x::"Your friends will go mess with the gods," he continued, staring intently at Aiden, then turning his gaze to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]: "You don't mess with the gods, do you?")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thought for a moment before admitting they were worshippers of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]. This fact made [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] throw his cane down in frustration. He earnestly looked Hafblie in the eyes, hoping that was the start and end of it. His smile faltered when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] hesitated to answer the Cleric.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] eventually said, "Well... I technically birthed a God.. I think that's the correct terminology...")

(x::"...You did what?")

(x::"I... birthed a God")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] frantically looked for support from the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Still, when he found nothing but quick, awkward glances, he returned to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and, with a nervous curiosity, asked which God it was.)

(x::"It was [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]], if i remember correctly," [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] recounted, "A dead god that i somehow become the father of. Although i didn't epect to be a fdather at the age of 22..." their voice trailed off as [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] stumbled back, his face a visage of shock and worry.)

(x::His worry quickly turned to panic, and he began to hyperventilate and have a panic attack. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] commented that they may have given [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] too many Gods before asking if the man was OK. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] commented that the doctor dealt with all things death, so it should not be too bad. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] commented that this was the type of thing that happened when you realise how shit the world is.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] helped [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] calm down by getting them to breathe regularly through his mouth and out through his nose. Once the doctor had calmed down, he asked if they could go somewhere more private to talk about his, gesturing to the various townsfolk around. They went upstairs to the councillors' offices. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] realised that Hallfbie was humming a song from a popular band called My Alchemical Romance, and they tried their best to suppress their laughter.)

(x::They all sat silently in the room as [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] tried to think of an explanation that didn't make him seem like a massive hypocrite. He eventually relented and said, "In my exploration to get myself the power to resurrect the dead and ehm. There's a reason I'm an excellent doctor and can bring people back from death. Although it did it yesterday, if the death occurred more than 5 days ago, conventional magic cannot return them. Although this doesn't matter if you have a key," he gestured to his cloak, "This is a divine artefact, it allows me to trespass into his domain and steal divine magic and bring people back. This was a relatively safe thing to do as there was a guardian for the other side, but now you tell the guardian has returned.")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] explained to a judgmental party that channelling divine energy isn't a problem; the gods attached to that energy are the problem. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] agreed, saying it was fine yesterday when they used some. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] disagreed with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], stating that he did not see what happened and didn't believe the rebels would run away. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nervously spoke up, confirming that everything turned up and everyone ran away.)

(x::Halbfie commented that it seemed like everyone got up to a lot while they were away. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained how they used Sefier to scare everyone away. In return, when the time arrived, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] promised to eat some fried chicken. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] continued saying there were some rebels, a large cannon, and a weird vulture thing, and he assured [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had nothing to do with his own vulture clock. A lie that only Aiden seemed to pick up on, Aiden didn't challenge the lie, instead shooting the doctor a glance that sent chills down his spine.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] quickly said," Don't look at me like that! You're [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' puppet, aren't you?")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to reason that puppet was a strong word, but [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] stated it was an apt description of what he had been told, something none of them could refute. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] adjusted his clock and his attitude, apologised for these previous comments, and expressed how interested he was in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s dynamic and adventures. For the most part, they accepted the apology, and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] moved on to the next topic of interest: the events that took place while he was away.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that the rebels had a Canon, which they used to attack [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the Black Tower]], leading [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to, in their own words, "make the excuative decision to consult with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] to see if she would be able to help. They made a deal with her that she would chase the rebels away in exchange for some fried chicken. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] pointed out that it was a real delicacy in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] and a must-try food when in the region. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] commented that it was no chicken noodle soup, but they were willing to try it. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then spent a few minutes avidly explaining the concept of Chicken noodle soup to a very confused [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], who seemed to have never tried it.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was intrigued and suggested they make it. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] brought out their heavy spell book, which had notes attached to every page. Incense and wax covered the whole book, giving it an otherworldly aura. One of the pages had the recipe that Jessamine left behind. They all surround [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], reading the recipe, causing their stomachs to all growl.)

(x::Now, getting a closer look at the book, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] commented, "Oh, I like your spell book. I have a book; there is not really a spell, but it's got some spells in it, and it's mainly for potions." He pulled out his own book; it was much smaller and slightly warm to the touch. Flicking to one of the last pages, he showed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a spell and asked if they could lend him some of their expertise.)

(x::Instantly interested in a new spell, they looked through the notes and confirmed they could help with it. The spell was called Legen Lore, allowing the caster to learn anything substantial about a legendary subject. Together, they worked through the spells' requirements until a gathering of energies sounded them. The final part of the spell was to say what you wanted to learn about. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] looked to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and said [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow in a forboding voice. Suddenly, knowledge flooded into his brain.)

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] was a powerful and talented general in the army of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]]. During one of the most climactic battles, she sacrificed herself and was promoted to [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] status. She was responsible for the torching of [[Locations/The Desert/Emberfall\|Emberfall]].)

(x::Looking up, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] exclaimed, "Congratulations, you have the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] in your head!")

(x::In [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s head, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] counters by saying [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] technically travelled with a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] for ages, so why would she be any different? [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked if he could speak with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] directly. But she refused to engage with him and went as far as to insult him. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] didn't care about the insults but was disappointed he couldn't speak to her. With the main topic of discussion finished, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] chatted for a while, comparing notes and knowledge from recent events.)

(x::However, the conversation became tense when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quipped that sometimes it's good to just give a middle finger to the world around you. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stepped in, asking what the heck [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wished to talk about. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reluctantly and extremely bluntly explained that his friend had recently died, and they had even lost full control over their bodies. The silence was deafening. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] just sat there, looking at their shoes, and expressed their utter ignorance about what to do now, knowing this.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] knew of a spell to fix their ailment. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] explained that there wasn't a lot of magic that could help the illness of the mind. He cast some regular healing spells but doubted they would do anything. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suddenly brightened as they exclaimed, "They knew what they should do." They bolted out of the room with an apprehensive and confused party close on their tail.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] ran to the mages guild and asked the front desk person if they had a professor who specialised in magic that helped with mental health. At first, the receptionist ignored them, but after some pestering, they snapped and said they would not be here if they had magic like that. After some further pestering, the receptionist revealed that they had a doctor who might be able to help.)

(x::His name was [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mr Placebo\|Mr Placebo]], and his office was down the corridor. Many in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] exchanged nervous glances as this was the corridor with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]], the mad wizard. Halfnbie entered the doctor's office and was greeted by a long, crazed man with long, wiry, white hair. The man looked up and shouted, then spoke, "Oh hello, Sonny. Sit your ass down. How can I help?")

(x::They sat down, excited for their consolation. Halkfbie explained the reset events and how they were making them feel. To everyone's surprise, the doctor explained he had been through the same thing. This knowledge actually helped [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a bit, as now they weren't the only ones who had experienced something so insane. The man got out his book and began casting a spell that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] instantly recognised as a [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|Minor illusion]], which caused some tental to appear around his head.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked when the real spell would happen, as they could cast minor illusions. The doctor looked worried and exclaimed he would now use a more powerful spell, which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also instantly recognised as a significant image. The doctor replied solemnly that his magic seemed powerful enough to solve [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s problems. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] simply nodded, "That's alright. God truly has abandoned us," and slowly walked out.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] mocked an apology to the doctor and courted [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] in the mage guild atrium. Exclaiming that halfbies have a lot of big feelings at the moment, and talking about it would help. In the atrium, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] still stood focusing on making a spell, weaving hand signs and chants together to try and create a spell that could [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] studied the incantation, gave the doctor a few pointers, and helped complete the spell, which ended up having a [[Admin/Spells/Prestidigitation\|prestidigitation]] effect.)

(x::Giving up on the spell, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked Halfbioe if they could give them more information about what was bothering them so much. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that their main worry was that they didn't even have control over their bodies.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if they had ever talked to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that apart from that time at [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], they had never spoken to the man.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that it seemed like [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] needed to have a big conversation about consent, like the one they and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] had had. "Taking over someone else's body, that is not originally yours. It can be highly stressful, obviously. Extremely stressful sometimes, and there needs to be boundaries put in place, so if there is a situation where you are trouble is isn't as bad.")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that every time [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] takes over, they talk about it, so [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] knows precisely what is happening. They also explained that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] is not a bad person, probably didn't intend to cause harm, and was trying to help.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s face was unreadable, and they stared at [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. They tried to think of a way to explain the situation. Finally, they asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to come with them to a nearby mirror. With both looking in, they asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] what they saw. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] plainly stated themselves as they fixed their hair.)

(x::"See!" This is what I'm talking about," [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaimed. I don't even get to see myself when I look in." [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tentatively asked what they saw. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s face darkened as they explained, "I see three faces staring back at me. None of them belongs to me. Two of them are gods, and the other is dead. The worst part is that I don't know which I hate more: that three faces aren't mine or that I am no longer included in my reflection.")

(x::After confirming that the two gods were [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] and [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]], [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] surmised that this sounded like a possession and could be solved with a spell. But warned that using the spell would rid the body of the possessor and kill that spirit. Upon hearing this, a graverly voice rang in [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s head, asking if it would be OK to take over. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said yes, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] watched as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] took over. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] instantly recognised that something had happened as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s entire demeanour had changed. They held themselves differently; their eyes showed minimal emotion, and they spoke with the cadence of a professor.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] spoke with authority, " i wouldn't do that if i were you")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked why that was the case. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] explained, "It is not I who possesses this body, this boy's body.")

(x::They all stood in silence at the revelation. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was the first to speak, asking for clarification on what [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] was talking about. As he didn't understand, "Is it the other way around? That doesn't make sense to me, as I understand it. This is not your original body.")

(x::"This body is not mine, no")

(x::"but the body isn't [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s either?" questioned [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].)

(x::"No... That bitch works in mysterious ways," Chenis said, practically spitting the goddess's name as he spoke.)

(x::"So she just gave you the body Then?" asked [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]].)

(x::"Yes. I assumed if you tried to revoke the soul from this body, it would take the boy's soul instead of mine." said [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] coldly.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]'s eyes flashed a brilliant green as he used his eyes of the god ability to look at [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s body. He was expecting to see if [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s body was undead, as it would essentially be a dead person being possessed. His eyes returned to normal as he declared he had another idea.)

(x::Vivtor began describing a powerful spell called [[Admin/Spells/Simulacrum\|Simulacrum]], which duplicated the body, and suggested they use it to give each person their own body.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] pointed out the downside: once a [[Admin/Spells/Simulacrum\|simulacrum]] used all of its magic, it could not regain it. He said that simply would not do. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] then asked if there was anything else he could help with. They figured everything out. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] explained he had a lot of ongoing research and pulled out a large stack of books he asked [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] to help with. He gave each book with a summary of its contents. He got to one of the books and began to hand it over before taking it back, explaining that it might be too complicated for the doctor.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] has been hesitant and overwhelmed by the research he has been given. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is trying to calm him down and explain the situation, which is why [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] reacted the way he did. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] could not comprehend this, insisting that it was all riveting research that anyone would be lucky to read through.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] put the books down and switched topics: "Can you hear everything [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] can hear? Could you comment on...")

(x::"Yes, I can... well, they can hear everything i can hear", [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] interrupted.)

(x::"right... I do not like that turn of phrase... but you are correct...")

(x::"That is what I do", he responded curtly.)

(x::"I quite like this man [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]... he is so sure in himself's)

(x::"He. Soreat... so. Have you heard of a custody battle?" said [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] awkwardly.)

(x::"Is that when you throw custard at one's enemy?" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] asked a speechless [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], "or are we talking in the legal sense?" but before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could say anything, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] simply stated, "eitherway i couldn't say as it isn't magic")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] paused for a moment before continuing, "Oh, I forgot you have your specialist subject. That's the one. The one thing that you know. It's when two people come to an agreement...")

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] interrupted again, claiming he knew this one. He pulled out the Kuma sutra and explained the process of making a child. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly shot this down before it got graphic and explained that they were simply trying to point out that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] needed to have a conversation about who has control over the body. This would allow both to have the best of both worlds.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] jumped into continuing his question and asked [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] to give his thoughts on Victor's use of divine energy. This made the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] tense up, bracing themselves for the onslaught. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] sniffed his moustache for a moment before simply stating, "Sloppy." Victor's face fell as he asked for clarification.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] gave an in-depth analysis of the incantation, figuring out that most of [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] did it instantly. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] explained that he had seen something done before, and such a sloppy incantation was hardly something to be proud of.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] tried to get past the criticism and simply stated that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] wouldn't always be the smartest person in the room, getting rid of his attitude. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] looked at [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] down the bridge of his nose and said, "Incorrect, I am always the smartest in the room.")

(x::The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] sighed at the predictable outcome, with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stating, "Victor, give up. This is the road he will die on. In fact, he has")

(x::And with a smirk, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stated, "And I would do it again")

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] then looked around and decided that he should give the boy back control. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] tried to interject by saying the body had a name, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] clapped back, stating that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was a boy to him before shifting control back to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over and asked how they were doing, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] seemed worse off than before and simply stated, "I thought I had at least control over my body..." [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] melted and suggested talking about it. This infuriated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who snapped, "I would, but in case you forgot, my friend was killed, turned into a demi-god, and I lost ownership over my body. I don't think that is something you can just talk about.")

(x::Everyone fell silent as Hgalfbie pushed everyone to move. They opened a small notebook branded with 'Ye olde pub down the road' and listed off their to-do list and what they needed to do. They all decided that instead of leaving [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], they should probably figure out what was happening with the rebels. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they knew where the rebel base was and that they even had the secret key, so it would be best to go in and try to solve everything diplomatically.)

(x::They made their way through the back streets and found the hideout. Before approaching, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used the [[Admin/Spells/Disguise Self\|disguise self]]-spell on both him and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. It was decided that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] should be the one who approached the hideout and got in. Upon giving the secret knock, they were allowed in and found themselves in a bare room with a set of stairs in a connected room. Going down, they found themselves in a speakeasy with a large bar and crowded tables. On the far side was a door that had to be guarded in front.)

(x::Approaching the guard, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if they could gain entrance. They were initially reluctant but soon convinced to let everyone through. Inside was the rebel leader, who was talking with his generals over a map of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. The conversation stopped when the group walked into the room. The leader gruffly asked what they were doing in the room, to which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained they were just there to talk and try to broker a pease deal.)

(x::The leader explained that peace was not an option, and they were fighting so the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] would be free again and allowed to operate however they pleased. Notably, he used Ehobels' system of governance as an example of what they wanted to do in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. After further prodding, it was revealed that the leader, although not Elven himself, was part of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and was sent to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] by [[Admin/Spells/Command\|command]] of Empress [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]].)

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] could not believe what they were hearing, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested that it could be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] impersonating her. The leader told them that his group would not stop until all the towns in the land were free to elect their own leaders. Among those leaders, the ruler of the territory would be chosen. He even said that [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] could remain under [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s control as long as the others were free.)

(x::The leader and his guards all left to give [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] time to consider the offer. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] was suspicious of the leader, mainly because he was a spy from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and couldn't be trusted to keep his word. They decided to put some safeguards in place. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast Glyph of warding and made it explode if anyone in the room decided to go back on the deal of peace they brokered today.)

(x::Notably, while this was all happening, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] spent some time casting Legend Lore again, this time saying [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. However, when the spell was finished, the only information that was given was that no one called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]].)

(x::When the leader returned, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] told him their plan. He laughed, but before he could do anything, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] cast [[Admin/Spells/Charm Person\|Charm Person]] on the leader and asked him to explain his true intentions in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. The leader laughed manically and explained that the true purpose of the plan was to destabilise the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to aid [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]]. The leader then explained that his original plan was to blow everyone up and enjoy doing it. The laughter was crazed, and the leader's body began to glow with brilliant light. Before they could react, the leader exploded. Raident and fire magic burst from the man's body, slamming [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] against the wall, killing, burning, or destroying everyone and everything around them.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was knocked out cold by the blast, with the rest barely hanging on. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] quickly performed a posture on the boy, revitalising him. The building around them was quickly crumbling, and if they didn't act fast, they would be buried in the city. They all looked at [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], pulled out their book, and cast [[Admin/Spells/Fabricate\|Fabricate]] to contract a set of support pillars for the stairs. They ran through the flames of the building, jumping over bodies and dodging survivors, making a break for nearby tunnels. They reached the stairs and escaped the building.)

(x::They stood on the streets of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], panting for breath. The hut they were in was a blaze, and survivors poured water out. In their heads, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] heard [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] say that the explosion was weak. To which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] apologised, saying that they should have trusted [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]'s warnings "Next time, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], we kill them all, then they can't hurt your friends")

(x::When asked what [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] was saying, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pretended not to know what they were talking about. Instead, they apologised for getting everyone hurt. Aiden insisted that they had nothing to apologise for as it was impossible to predict every outcome. Drahche agreed that they wouldn't have learnt as much as they did if they had gone in and killed everyone.)

(x::They all decide that they have to figure out if all the rebels are part of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen cult]] or if they've just been dragged into something much bigger. Seeing that they are surrounded by the rebels, who are all in shock, they think it would be best to question them now. In [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s head, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] told them that the rebels had to be burnt.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they didn't want to kill them and instead intimidated them like they did before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] agrees, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] watches in horror as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] begins to float off the ground with their arms outstretched. Fiery red wings appear on their backs. Suddenly, all of the rebels explode in flames and disintegrate instantly, not even leaving a pile of ash behind.)

(x::From [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s perspective, everything is fine, and the rebels run away unharmed.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is gently put back on the groan, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] all hear the same [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] in their heads from last time: [[Admin/Spells/Command\|command]] them never to reveal what they saw to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] will kill them. "Is it for your own good?")

(x::"[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responded to the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]], saying, "Erhm, a lot of people speak in my head. Who is this?")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hears the reply and asks what they mean. Speaking allowed, they are both confused by what happened. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also asks everyone if they should be trussing the person who is a member of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]] to help them fight [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]].)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was adamant that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] had left the cult and pointed out that she had helped them since joining [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] isn't convinced.)

(x::Seiffer speaks in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s head: "I think it is time to come clean. I do want something from you. But we can't do it here. I will explain more in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]], OK?")

(x::"I promise it has nothing to do with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]," she continued. I don't want him back any more than you do now.")

(x::"well.. thats what you said...")

(x::"My plan is more about revenge; it doesn't matter now. We'll talk later. For now, it seems your party is getting annoyed at you.")

(x::They stood there trying to process what had just happened, unsure how to proceed.)
