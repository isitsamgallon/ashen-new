# Session Summary 
As the party planned their route from the Wyvern’s Cave, they decided to head toward the Emerald Fort for rest and information. Drache was visibly tense upon entering the city, especially after learning that Genevieve's son, Kaes, now ran the Fort with a colder, more calculated hand. The group paid their respects at a new statue of Genevieve and discussed the theory of “Perpetuals”—humans who seem to live for centuries. After finding little information in the records room, the group suspected Genevieve may have had a secret lover and devised a plan to find them in the mess hall. During the festivities, Korrigan discovered a scarred soldier who accused Drache of killing his brothers during Drache’s darker days at Tulan Fort. Korrigan confronted Drache, who admitted his guilt, and urged him to make amends. Drache honoured this by accepting the man’s challenge to a sacred duel, ultimately winning but watching his opponent die due to the effects of the Dueler’s Brew.

The next day, the party awoke in unfamiliar surroundings: a filthy slave tent deep within the mines of Lost Haven. Without their equipment or the ability to cast magic, they quickly learned that they were trapped within an anti-magic field and forced into back-breaking labour. Korrigan began to relive traumatic memories of his past in Lost Haven, while Halfbie studied the magical suppression field, believing it was powered by something similar to the divine towers. The party were escorted to the surface where they saw the full extent of the horrors of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], and Korrigan led them to a small church dedicated to Ignatius, where a surprisingly kind priest welcomed them.

The priest preached a hopeful but twisted version of the teachings of Ignatius, describing the Sundering not as destruction, but as liberation—immortality through transformation into Ash Spawn. Halfbie questioned the morality and unknown pain of such immortality, leading to a deep but tense theological discussion. After being offered a small amount of food by the priest, the group exited the church and processed what they’d seen. Korrigan opened up to Mordecai about his origins in Lost Haven, revealing his original name, KA-1, and how he tried—and failed—to spark a revolution in the past. Mordecai assured Korrigan of his loyalty and declared he would burn the city to the ground if it meant Korrigan's freedom. As the session ended, Korrigan declared it was time to revisit his old home.

# Full Session Notes
(x::Standing at the threshold of the Wyverns Cave, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] paused to get their bearings and figure out where they needed to go. The Tour Du Ashen's hands accounted for them discovering a teleporting dwarven room and venturing back to the Wyverns Cave. Studying the map closely and referring to an old book they found recently, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they travel to The [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]], not only would it give them easy access to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], but it would give them all a chance to catch up with an [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]] business partner and to learn what happened after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death [^1]. The rest all agreed and began preparations to head off.)

(x::Before they left, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim]] approached them with a small black box with a large red button on it. He explained that if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] needed to use the room to travel, they could call him using this box. Thanking him for being so thoughtful, they all headed off for the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|emerald fort]].)

(x::After a few days of travelling, they finally saw the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|emerald fort]]'s white walls and green banners. As they approached, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] became increasingly nervous. Reaching the gate, the guards stopped them, asking what their business was with the fort. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they were allies from the war for the cause's freedom and wanted safe passage through to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. The guards quickly relaxed and explained they were more than welcome to enter, but if they wanted to travel to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], the fort just requested that they do it at night.)

(x::When pressed for a reason for this, the guards explained that the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]] and [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] have a somewhat turbulent relationship. According to the guard, [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] would rather trade with the southern colonies, as the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]] had become too unpredictable. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pushed them further, and they admitted that the fort didn't want to be seen as fraternising with other nations too much; they were supposed to remain neutral.)

(x::As the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] hung back, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nervously stayed put. He wanted to ask who was currently running the fort after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death. The guards explained that after her heroic death, her son, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Kaes\|Kaes]], took over. Unlike his mother, he is a very intelligent ruler, much colder and calculating. The conversation eventually turned to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], where guards admitted they had heard how bad it had gotten, and its reputation had been run into the ground. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] chimed in, asking the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]]'s opinion on unions. The guards explained they didn't have one as they were all family at the fort, leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uneasy.)

(x::With their conversation concluded, they entered the fort. It was much emptier than when they last visited, presumably because many of them were at the [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]]. Walking through the streets, they eventually came across a freshly made marble statue of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tugged at [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s sleeve and asked if he could make some flowers to lay at the statue. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] sadly explained he couldn't do it at the moment as he didn't have the spell prepared, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] could probably. The druid quickly stepped up and cast the spell Plant Growth, causing a field of flowers to bloom around the statue.)

(x::While the others had a moment of silence, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly got out the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and wrote in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s name. Ink slowly seeped into the ancient pages before being replaced with text that read, 'When [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] died, she was 334'. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] saw [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reading the book and peeked at the page before becoming amazed at how long [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] had been alive. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] nodded, saying that it had alluded them for a while now. A few of the [[Other Information/Races/Human\|humans]] involved in [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]] were hundreds of years old, even though they were only [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed in their notes that they had been calling these people Perpetuals. So far, they had listed Galen Verik, Caden Steelbreaker and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] as all pertutals, with only Galen having a somewhat concrete explanation [^2].)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wondered if they had a record room to look through to learn more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] assumed they probably did, as most places would have some form of central records, although they probably wouldn't be super detailed. They soon found the library, but it was primarily financial information and basic troop movement. There wasn't a lot about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]; the earliest records of her began a few years after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they find someone who knew her well and ask.)

(x::None of them knew who the second in command would be. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained that during his time at Tulan Fort, there was a rumour that she had a lover who looked like a troll. He explained that they probably could trust the troll part, but she probably did have a lover. Upon hearing this, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] immediately became very interested and started trying to picture the type of person [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s lover would be.)

(x::He surmised that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] was probably a very [Masc Lesbian](https://japangayguide.com/lesbian/masc-lesbians-all-you-need-to-know/). She was clearly very organised and sporty. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] surmised that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s girlfriend would most likely be a very Femme Lesbian, probably quite disorganised and with a bubbly personality. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] built on this assumption, thinking that the best place to find them would be in some bar or mess hall.)

(x::As they travelled there, they came up with a plan. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that man Femme lesbians are quite messy when they drink. So they suggested starting a drinking contest. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained he would use Elemenism to give [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s entrance some dramatic effect, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] would start the contest. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan would then watch for anyone who could be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s lover. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thought to themselves before getting out their spell book. After muttering a few words, a glowing orb began to take the form of an Elven face. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then commanded it to fly into the mess hall with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], fly up to the roof, and give [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a top-down view of everything.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] casts his spell, causing gusts of wind to fling the doors open and close the shutters. He then gave way to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], who walked in and began expectantly performing for the room. While preparing to announce the drinking contest, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] noticed a man with heavy facial scarring staring at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] intently. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] gets two beers, and Misty Steps over to the man and offers him one.)

(x::The man boardline spits at Kerrigan and gruffly tells him he didn't need any charity from the likes of him. The man goes back to staring at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. Now that he is closer, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] notices this stare is one of hatred. Looking between the man and his companion, Kerrigan smirked before saying Emmaline. The man whipped his head around to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], his eyes blazing with fury, before spitting on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] instantly casts a charm on the man, and he instantly calms down.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] takes this opportunity to ask why the man is so angry with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. The man tells him that a few years ago, he was on patrol with his two brothers. They are eventually sent to a nearby village that reported some trouble with local ruffians. He gets to the town where 12 men jump out at them and beat them. The man's two brothers were beaten so severely that they eventually died of their injuries. He then looked at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and explained that the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] at the bar was part of the group that jumped his brothers.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] thanked him for his time, approached [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], and asked if he could speak to him outside. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] questioned [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] about the man's story, and the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]'s usual happy personality quickly faded to one of solemn shame. He stuttered his way through an explanation, saying, "I buried a lot of bodies in the past. I'm not proud of any of it. I hate myself for it." He explained that he tried every day to be a better person, which was one of the main reasons he left Tulan Fort.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] reiterated that he was not that person anymore, but he could not continue to be a good person if he didn't right his wrongs when given the chance. He explained that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had to talk to the man inside; he just had to decide whether he would be charmed or not during that conversation. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] opted to remove the man's charm, and with a nod of approval from [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], the charm was released.)

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] awkwardly reentered the mess hall and approached the man, who was visibly angry again. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] joined [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and the others at the bar. As he approached, he had never heard [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asking [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] what they were about to drink, which was called Tequila. With a knowing grin, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] confirmed this, explaining the method for drinking Tequila with salt and lime. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knocked the shot back before pulling a disgusted face.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained he would join in, but the last time he drank, he got mad and became a demon. With slightly slurred speech, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they had heard from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Bronumas, The Devourer\|Bronumas]] since the divorce. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained that he was thankful he hadn't.)

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sat at the table with the man. They both took a long swig of their drinks. After pausing, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] said, "So, Long time no see".)

(x::"i wishi couldve killed you earlier", sneered the man.)

(x::"yeah, youd be surprised, how many people have said that to me.")

(x::The man laughed hollowly, "you know you're the last of 12? The last on my list.")

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] took a swig before saying, "And then what do you do after Is it your purpose complete? Is that when you'd be fulfilled?")

(x::"No. I suppose not." said the man, "It won't bring them back, but that doesn't matter")

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to explain that he left Tulan a long time ago and had tried his hardest to change for the better. The man didn't care and just said he needed his bound of flesh to complete his mission. Then he called the bartender over and whispered something in their ear. After hearing the order, he asked if he was absolutely sure, and the man confirmed he was. There were a few moments of silence before the bartender returned with two shot glasses, one in front of the man and the other in front of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].)

(x::The man stared at the glass. He asked about Emmaline, wondering how she fared. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] proudly explained that he had managed to save her from Tulan. The man was delighted to hear she was safe and was even happier to hear how she was now off saving the world and travelling. His smile faded as he said, "You'll drink with me, won't you?" [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] Solmun picked up the glass and clinked it with the man.)

(x::The man stood up, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] followed suit as they walked out of the bar to a nearby training facility. Then he gestured for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to pick up whatever weapon they wanted. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] instinctively gravitated to the greatsword on the table. The man did the same, and they began their duel. The fight wasn't close, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly overpowered the man and soon knocked him to the ground unconscious and bleeding.)

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] looked at the man on the ground with pity, healed him back to consciousness, and knelt to meet his gaze. The man explained that the drink they had earlier was called the Dueler's Brew. He explained that the potion enforced the sacred rites of the duel, causing people to die if they ran away or got others to help them. But it also had a third function: it would kill whoever lost, no matter what. They laughed at the thought of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s kindness, only serving to cause him more pain. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] did his best to make him comfortable and offered the man a prayer. The man smiled, knowing he would soon see his brothers.)

(x::There was a long pause, and no one knew what to do or say. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly approached [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], who stood stock still, resting on the hilt of his blade. With a soft hand on the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]'s shoulder, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they go and drink away their sorrows. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] turned to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] with a sad grin and said, That plan was the best thing he had heard all day.)

(x::They returned to the mess hall and began to drink copious amounts of alcohol. As the night carried on, they all drank too much and one by one passed out.)

(x::The next day, they woke up with splitting headaches. Although the air was difficult to breathe and smelled foul, they propped themselves up again against the thick cloth walls and found themselves in a circular tent with two others. To their alarm, none of them had any of their equipment or weapons. One of the people in the tent greeted them, commenting on how it wasn't often they saw new faces in the mines.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] began to panic as old memories of his time as an enslaved person here began to resurface. Unable to sit still, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] immediately got up and opened the door to the tent, revealing that they were deep in a large mine shaft. With the door open, the tent was flooded with dust, making breathing even more difficult. Standing by the entrance, he grimly said, "Welcome to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]")

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned his attention to a young girl sitting balled up in one end of the tent. He went to cast Healing magic on the girl, who had many wounds all over her body, but when he went to do it, his magic failed. The girl looked up to him and went to say something, but she was unable to form words correctly because her tongue had been cut out. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to cast a message to talk to the girl, but found their magic wouldn't work.)

(x::The other person in the tent stepped forward into the light, saying, "Yeah, they did that after last time")

(x::"What happened last time? Who did what?" questioned [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].)

(x::The man explained that a few years ago, there was a rebellion, and a revolutionary force used magic to burn many of the doors down to let the slaves escape. When asked, the man explained the salves rose against the [[Groups & Factions/Luminara\|Luminara]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] chimes in to clarify that the Laminar is the name of the inner sanctum where the elites live. Much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s dismay, their stuff was most likely stored in a museum for the rich people if it hadn't already been sold to the highest bidder.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they knew anything about how they were blocking the magic, but the person had no idea; it was just some kind of barrier. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was sceptical, as this was a massive mine, so the barrier would have to be stupidly strong and powered by a lot of magic. The man agreed but stated that they didn't really have the time to think about it.)

(x::Suddenly, the door swung open, and a huge, hulking man walked into the tent. In one hand, he held a long sword, and in the other, a giant sword. He stood there and shouted like a drill sergeant, "Enough chatting, you lot. Get to work.")

(x::They slowly get up and follow the enslaver into the mines. They soon reached a freshly excavated part where they were given pickaxes, which were chained to their wrists with heavy iron cuffs, and told to mine. As they begin to mine, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] notices the little girl from the tent barely being able to lift the pickaxe, he approached he to help. But as he reached out his hand, a whip suddenly snapped at it, drawing blood. The salver screamed at [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], telling him to focus on his work.)

(x::While they worked, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to figure out how the antimagic field would work. They surmise that the magic at work felt quite similar to how [[Other Information/The Towers\|the towers]] functioned. It would also have to be very close to the centre of the mines to cover the whole area.)

(x::After 14 hours of back-breaking work, the slaver shouts, "Right, that's your shift over!!" and unshackles them from their pickaxes. Then, he leads them out of the mines and back into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. The man from the tent asks if they would like to see the surface, to which they all agree. Going through a significant checkpoint, they found themselves in an even worse slum as people covered in bruises slept in puddles of their filth, inches away from another slave in the same condition.)

(x::The man led the way, explaining that their tent was considered to be relatively luxurious compared to how the rest lived. If they followed him, he would show them where they could get some food. They soon arrived at a slightly cleaner area where a large building with assigned, labelled food could be found. He then grabbed the girl's hand and walked over to get a bite to eat.)

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to the group and sarcastically asked if they were enjoying their time in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], to which [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] just sarcastically replied by asking if there were any good sites to see. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] nodded and directed them to a smaller building nearby, which [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained was the closest thing to a church in the area. He explained he wanted to pay his respects to his friend Sara. He invited them to join him in doing so.)

(x::The building was relatively clean and mostly empty apart from a few ancient-looking pews. The priest came over to greet them. To their surprise, the priest carried the symbol of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] on his robes and altar.)

(x::Seeing everyone's confusion, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] stated, "I mean, say what you want about [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], but to the people here, he was a chance of change, of cleansing this place of what it is.")

(x::With a kind smile, the priest ushered them to some nearby pews, welcomed them to his church, and hoped that none of them had been whipped too hard today. He then asked if they knew much about [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that a lot more than the average person. The priest was elated and asked if they knew of [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]]. And was even more elated when the answer was yes. "That's good, good, you've heard the old stories then. And I'm sure you see my filth out there," he said.)

(x::"I mean, we've read multiple things." explained [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::"Ah, you've read the scripts? " the priest questioned)

(x::"Yeah, some pretty old scripts. I wish we had it with us. We could have shared it with you." [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] confirmed.)

(x::"Yeah They don't allow much in nowadays." said the priest)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] agreed, saying, "It was written a few hundred years ago. So it would have been a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] of a relic")

(x::The priest looked sad for a moment before continuing, "Now tell me, my children, you've seen [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], you've seen the villainy of these so-called protectors, ones that whip us, the ones that treat us like dogs." He paused a moment before continuing, "How would you like a change? A change from whips, a change from chains?")

(x::He explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] offers change and that the next Sundering will wipe the world of all its sins and free the salve around them of their suffering. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] countered by saying that he would wipe everything clean and leave nothing but the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]].)

(x::"See, that's the interesting thing, my dear. Who do you think wrote all the modern texts on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]]? Do you think it was us? Do you think it was the poor and pitiless? Do you think it was the followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]?" the priest countered, "Or do you think it was the rich? Do you think it was those who didn't want it to happen again? Those that perhaps had a vested interest in keeping the status quo?")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] spoke up and explained that he had read those books, but the one they mentioned earlier was actually written by a priest of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. "It does paint the picture, obviously, in a more positive way, but it still comes across as an unrelenting wave where everyone is turned to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]]")

(x::The priest laments that the book is not around for him to read but says, "Let's say that was true. He still made [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]], did he not? So, say he made the bunch of us into [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]]. Sure, we'd come on and do what he wills, but once he's gone, once he's done with it, are we not immortal? Are we not immortal beings allowed to wander and do as we will?")

(x::Upon hearing this, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] walks out of the building. The priest muttered about how some people can't handle the truth. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked the priest how he knew being part of the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] wouldn't be agony. The priest counted buy asking "how do we know life right now isn't agony")

(x::Halfbnie shot back, "Oh, we know that life can be agony, but it's all the time. If being [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] is agony, then we would be in pain forever and immortals. ")

(x::The priest conceded that he would never know any of this, but it was something he hadn't considered, and he thanked them for the interesting conversation. Halfbiue explained that they didn't mind what people did in their own time and weren't here to judge, so they also enjoyed the conversation.)

(x::The priest changed the subject to food, stating that when new slaves are brought, the church offers them extra rations. Due to the lack of food in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], this is only a one-time thing, so they shouldn't get used to it. The priest then handed them two radishes, some cabbage, and a few leeks. This should make the first few meals a bit nicer for you," he said with a smile. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] thanked the priest before grabbing the food.)

(x::"I'll see you again, my children. Thank you for a talk. It was very enlightening," the priest said with a friendly wave.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] returned the wave, but halfway through, their eyes switched from their usual kind to one filled with hatred. It was only a moment, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] caught the change.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] joined [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] outside, leaning against the wall and taking everything in. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] casually asked how much [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] remembered from their time here. Without meeting [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s gaze, he replied, "I remember being born here. I remember my name not being Kal. My name was K-A-1. That's the name they gave me. So, you know, my dad shortened it to Kal. Or made it into Kal. I am supposed to be a miner. That didn't work out. I was allergic to something in the mine and something in my father's forge. So I was trained to be a hunter. And then things get fuzzy after my 18th birthday.")

(x::He explained that he and his friend did everything they could to try to change things. They wrote pleas to the king, a book, and everything else. They even sent a petition to half the people in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], saying they would stay if they were given freedom and a small wage. As [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] recounted the memory, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stepped in front of [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and looked at him with a look of seriousness and certainty that [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] had never seen before.)

(x::"We're going to get through this. I think of you as my brother." Said [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], his hand resting reassuringly on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s shoulders, "If it means burning this place to the fucking ground, I would become a monster so that you can be free.")

(x::[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] steeled himself, memories of people fighting flashed through his head as he said, "I think... its time we go see my old home")

- When trying to figure out [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]]'s lover, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]] and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] assumed she was a lesbian, unfortunately [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rolled a 12 so we are unsure if this is canon or not. 
- The face that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]  conjures is a part of their new Manifest Mind feature. They can share their sense with it and even cat spells through it. The face is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]].
