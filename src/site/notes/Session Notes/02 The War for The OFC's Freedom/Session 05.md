(x::The journey to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] began with trepidation and wonder as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ascended a winding stone staircase carved into the side of a steep cliff. The stairs extended upwards, seemingly into the void, with no visible destination in sight. The researchers accompanying them climbed without hesitation, their confidence reassuring yet unsettling in the surreal landscape. When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] reached the top, the world below vanished as if consumed by a misty veil, and before them emerged [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], the legendary floating city. Suspended on colossal glowing rocks, the city’s architecture seemed to defy gravity itself, an ethereal marvel held aloft by ancient magic.)

(x::The city stretched out in all directions, its towers and spires piercing the sky like crystalline needles. Bridges of enchanted crystal connected the floating islands, each step illuminating the paths with faint pulses of energy. The faint hum of arcane power filled the air, accompanied by the soothing sounds of fountains and cascading waterfalls. The main island at the heart of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] was dominated by a grand hall with gilded rooftops that glistened in the sunlight. The emblem of the academy, a bird with wings spread wide, perched atop its highest spire, a symbol of knowledge soaring above the mundane world. Surrounding this central hub, islands dedicated to each school of magic floated in a loose circle, each a microcosm of its discipline. The gardens of Transmutation were lush and alive, their vibrant flora shifting hues in a mesmerising display. Illusion’s domain shimmered like a mirage, its buildings reflecting light in ways that made their boundaries seem uncertain, while Necromancy’s grounds brooded in muted shadows, their spectral energy palpable even from afar.)

(x::As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] traversed the shimmering crystal bridges, their footsteps resonated with subtle vibrations, as though the city itself acknowledged their presence. The streets bustled with students and scholars, robed in an array of vibrant colours representing their fields of study. Conversations floated on the air, ranging from debates on magical theory to hushed whispers about the complexities of spells. The sheer magnitude of knowledge housed in [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] was both awe-inspiring and humbling and for a moment, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] could almost forget the weight of their mission.)

The researchers led them to the city’s vibrant core, weaving through opulent shops and bustling avenues. While the others absorbed the sights, Korrigan slipped away unnoticed, drawn to the promise of the academy’s famed library. The library was a labyrinth of towering shelves and shadowed alcoves, its scale dwarfing even the grandest halls [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had seen. Korrigan’s footsteps echoed softly as he delved deeper, his gaze alighting on an ancient tome hidden amidst layers of dust. Its title, _On the Divine Pillars and the World’s Mantle_, caught his eye. As he read, his expression shifted from wonder to unease.

(x:: The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned.)

(x:: Meanwhile, the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] followed the researchers to a laboratory bustling with arcane energy. There, the researchers proposed integrating the core of an airship into [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]], the automaton companion, to restore his mobility. As tools clinked and diagrams were drawn, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] was temporarily retrofitted, allowing him to float gently above the ground. The sight of [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] tethered like a balloon brought laughter, but the mood turned serious as the researchers explained the intricacies of the task. Full integration would take time and skill, and while the researchers offered their services freely, success was not guaranteed. Reluctantly, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] left [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] in their care, trusting in their expertise.)

(x:: The group regrouped near [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] ’s teleportation hub, their next destination [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. The hub was a grand hall filled with travellers and bustling attendants. A blue-scaled kobold manned the reception desk, efficiently arranging their passage and handing them a slip with their room number and departure time. With an hour to spare, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] dispersed to explore. Korrigan, drawn to a coffee shop run by a golden-scaled dragon, convinced Mordecai to join him for tea. However, the cost of their drinks—fifty [[gold\|gold]] —left Korrigan floundering. Mordecai, with a resigned sigh, unclasped his golden chain and offered it as payment. The gesture went unacknowledged as Korrigan accepted his tea in silence, a heavy mix of gratitude and guilt weighing on him.)

(x::When the time came, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] entered the portal room, its polished marble floors and glowing walls humming with arcane energy. The room’s intricate archway shimmered like a pool of water, beckoning them to step through. As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] prepared to leave [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] behind, they couldn’t shake the feeling that the academy had left its mark on them. The knowledge gained and sacrifices made in this city of magic would shape the choices and challenges that lay ahead, their journey only just beginning.)
