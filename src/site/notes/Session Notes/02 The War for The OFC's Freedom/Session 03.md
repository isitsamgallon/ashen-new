(x:: They climb the mountain to try to find the Wyven's lair. The group reasons that this is what Kal ‡ would’ve wanted. The group eventually find it - it's not a naturally occurring cave, more like it was hollowed out long ago. The lair is full of bookshelves with ancient books written in ancient dwarvish. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] takes one of the books for further study and in the hopes of learning the language. Mordecai Reverence recognised the language from his travels. This language is found all over the cave and even on the four pillars that are holding up the cave. The group decided that it was best to leave for Steelwick to learn not only more about the books but also about what was going on with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]].)

(x:: As the group gets to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] they hear a Familiar voice asking the party for any food. They turn to face the character and the person looks and sounds exactly like Kal but this person has antlers. He calls himself Korrigan and has amnesia. The group takes him in more out of curiosity (Chenris keep trying to securely study him).  Mordecai then scare Korrigans  into using his abilities to learn more about him and his abilities. [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] 's name comes up a lot when talking about his powers, he even has Kal's Bow. )

(x:: The group then decided its about time to turn in their quest for delivering the donkey. Korrigan is terrified when he finds out that the clerk at [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] wanted to eat the Donkey. Kerrigan thinks all animal lives a sacred. Eventually they get the donkey to safety with a farmer. )

(x:: They decide to go to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's family home and Learn more about him. Theyre stopped by and old and gross farmer who is VERY horny. Korrigan strikes a say pose but that doesn't do it for the groundskeeper, explaining that he more into "studs". After putting on some make-up, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] give it a go and is successful in getting past the grounds keeper. (Dm dies a little inside))

(x:: We meet [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's Dad and he is a raging arsehole. He is very dismissive and hatful towards Steve and is even unaware of what he has been doing for the last few years, thinking Steve is still in his room after all this time. The party scam the nobel into giving them gold to check on Steve. They venture to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's old room & find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] wanting to talk to them, teasing them about how doesn't know who he is and then disappears into another portal, after telling them that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] wants to see them. )

(x:: The party decide to explore the castle, finding [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's diary detailing how in his childhood his father wasn't such a dick to his son, but actually quite good. There was a picture of Steve's mother as well but not much else. Although things seem idealic, investigating his room said otherwise when an ornate dagger was found under his bed and bedsheets out the window - an obvious escape plan. Steve is very confused. They leave his bedroom venture down to the basement find an old torture rack with a prison containing a little girl's dress and a bunch of love letters to Steve from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mistrel †\|Mistrel †]]. Upon reading the letter, Steve flys into a murderous rage aimed at his father. Mordecai uses [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|minor illusion]] to make it look like the door disappears to give them time to talk him down. )

(x:: Trying to figure and what the hell is going on with korrigan. They decide that they are next going to the library to read what they can on [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] - it is revealed that she is a deity and might've had a hand in whatever is going on with Korrigan. )

thinking that this is a bit too much the decide to go on a quest to explore and mysterious door that was recently dug up in the local mines. They go to the designated meeting place to find 3 researchers in white robes and bird/banner crest on it. They are from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] and have been invited to investigate this door. Chenris tries is his best to hid his face under his cloak they don't recognise him - Mordecai notices. 

The party realises that the  researchers have VERY similar energy to Chenris and they pretty much admit that the party is just cannon fodder while they did the real work. Mordecai is in a bad mood so when notices chenris at the back of the group hiding he calls out chenris's namer to see what happens. Luckily the researchers didn't hear. 

As they get to the entrance of the weird area Kerrigan casts a spell to see what they might be encountering and finds out that there are undead in the dungeon. Drache fails to open the door, only to find its a full not a push. 

The first room has puzzle in it. there a 4 pedestals , each with a coloured gem on it. Further into the room were more pedestals this time with riddles on them.. the riddles are as following:
1. I am the beginning of everything, the foundation upon which all rests. Yet I crumble with the lightest touch. What am I?
2. I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?
3. I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am i?
4.  The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?

No1 required the Red Gem
No2 required the Green Gem
No3 required the White Gem 
No4 required the Blue Gem

The next room had a mound of dirt in the middle with 4 tapestries surrounding it. Each had different seasons depicted on it. there were many attempts to solving this puzzle. it ended up requiring a seed to be planted and then be exposed to all the corresponding laments of the seasons to open the way.

Next was a simple room that had a door in it with the following written above it "OTTFFSS - What comes next?" the answer was "E" because it was **O**ne, **T**wo, **T**hree, **F**our, **F**ive, **S**ix, **S**even, **EIGHT**. 

Finally the group accounted a room where massive constructs were shovelling lava into a machine. Korrigan noticed mid-fight that the constructs were powered by lava as well, allowing the party to defeat them without anyone dying. to get to the next room there was a massive lava moat to cross. after some time the party realised there was a water pipe above them they could shoot to make the lava solid.
