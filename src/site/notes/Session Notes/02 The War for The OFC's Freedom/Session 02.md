(x:: The party are quickly swept off their feet by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] and were told to come with him to the site of an airship crash, they travelled half a day away to find a crashed airship in flames, upon investigation kal notices some of the soldiers on board the airship had fake OFC uniform, they found a survivor which attacked them as soon as they noticed his fake uniform. The party take the survivor out of the airship and the guards kill them immediately due to being a threat to Caden. The party noticed it was an inside job. Outside the airship after investigating, a survivor the party missed walks out and up to cayden. As soon as the party notice the faulty uniform they go to intervene but the survivor yelled "FOR [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]" and exploded in a fiery explosion.  The party was injured and cayden was thrown against a tree, he seemed to be alive though unconscious but then the party was interrupted by a piercing roar and a wyvern descended onto the battle field. During the battle , Caden was killed due to a tree falling on. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] was later revealed to be behind this murder.  )

(x:: The party with the few remaining soldiers escorted Caden's dead body back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] but had to rest on the way, Kal and chenris were on watch but mysteriously fell asleep which was strange for chenris due to his elven lineage. When they woke up, Caden was alive and well but acting very strange. They try and investigate why and discovered someone came onto the camp and must of revived him , they arrived at Blackwall and rushed to the council building to alert the council of this, the party alert the council in the council chamber, Cayden burst into the room with a legion of dawn soldiers and tries to convince the party to join the dawn empire, the party refuses as the believe the OFC embodies freedom and they do not respect the racist ideals of the Dawn. The party fights Cayden and kill him again, they try and remove the body from the council building discretely but the body disappears as soon as their back is turned. )

The party leaves and rests in the local tavern and leave to go to the council building early in the morning.

Everyone at the council is horrendously drunk. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is preparing to attack. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] asks a very drunk guard for their keys - he is too drunk to care. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]], [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] sneak to the offices. 

Drache and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] both go to talk to people to get some more information to try and determine what is going on and what to do next. They talk and find that they should probably aim to unite against [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], however Drache opens up that he is not wanted near [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. Mordecai understands, as he is a fellow runaway and they agree to steer [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] away from the areas they absolutely don't want to go to.;

(x:: The other team bump into a hooded figure ([[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]) in one of the offices who roasts the hell out of Kal. Chenris find a tracked letter for the Sale of [[Locations/OFC/Firebranch Range\|Firebranch Range]] - The Dawn has been notified that Chenris has opened the letter as he is not the  the intended recipient.)

(x::  Chenris finds another Sale bill for [[Locations/OFC/Foxtail Orchards\|Foxtail Orchards]]. Similar bills are found in all of the offices. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] 's office was the last to be found. Chenris found a bunch of his notes on troop movements and the Pro/Cons of Dawn attack.)

(x:: The Hooded figure found what he was looking for, Chenris knows that Xekai is using forbidden magic. Xekai is the one that killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. He knew Mordecai + Drache even though they were pretending to be dumb. He silences Drache because he found then annoying and prefers talking to Mordecai. Since he has everything he needs, he opens a portal and Mordecai "accidentally" falls in the portal and manages to pickpocket some of the pages that he had stolen. Xakei finds this funny leaving the group with a few pages saying "got ya" and one official [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] documents.)

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] had a Locket hidden in fake suit of armour of an elven lady that the group thought be and old GF. They also found his first sword hung up on his wall above the fire place. The group leave to go to the Dawn , they use their leftover credits to buy luxury goods to convert to actual money.)

They group leaves for [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. On their travels, [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Haunter Crows\|crow]]s keep watching them until Drache uses speak with animals to find out they were bribed to watch them by their "master". Kal gives them some seed to go away and they do. 

The Whitespire town is filled with mages and surrounds a massive tower that goes to the heavens. This particular tower is one of 5 called [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. There are also towers in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. 

-- Long Rest --

A [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Haunter Crows\|crow]] watches Chenris sleep. 

(x:: Getting the boarder of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] runs into some guards that recognise [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] as part of a local nobel family. The only way for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to get through is by saying [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is a pat of Steve's entourage - meaning they don't need any documents. )

The Dawn really don't trust Non-Human races. Mordecai uses disguise self on Himself and [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|minor illusion]] to hid chenris' eyes. they go to the local [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to and pick up a quest to delivery a donkey to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. They next go to the local [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] to sell all of their luxury goods. The group sends a good amount of time haggling to get the best price - Drache backs down very fast, Chenris does slightly better but also doesn't fare to well. The clerk likes Kal's ring.

The Donkey bites Kal.

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] the Wise (Part of a small level 1 adventuring party made up of [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|halflings]]) pisses of the group by calling [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] weak as they keep bigging themselves up. This party mentioned how they were going to find dragons in the mountains near steelwick. The Group set up camp.)

Drache and Mordecai take the first watch. While on watch, they could hear someone singing a song about the 1000 year reign of the Dawn. Mordecai and Drache talk about how Drache has a lot of anxiety around going back to [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] - bonding moment. In the next watch, Chenris and Aidan find horses and Aidan is able to tame of the horses. in the next watch Kal sees a man in white robe. the robes an emblem of a bird with a crest and banner on it ([[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]). This leaves Chenris white with worry. 

The party sets off the next morning and travel through steel pass, a path that weaved its way up and through the mountains. Near the top they heard a deafening roar and watch merrick the wise's party pick a fight with a wyvern, they are loosing terribly.

--Fight--

Kal uses his new lightning bow to catch the Wyven's attention with a bolt of lightening. Mordecai uses Firebolt for the first time in years, misfires and hits on of the [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|halflings]]. 

Kal dies towards the end of the fight as Wyven attacks him when he is unconscious, impaling him with his claws . The monster is defeated while in the are and falls on top of Steve. meanwhile Mordecai is is desperately trying to use healing spells on Kal - to no avail.  

Kals body vanishes is a flash of mystical magenta light.
