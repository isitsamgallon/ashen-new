# Session Summary 
The session began with The Korrigan waking in horror next to his unexpected new husband, Bronumas, The Devourer, a demon whose brother would allegedly hunt Korrigan down if they divorced. Quick thinking (and blatant lying) convinced Bronumas that the marriage was invalid, prompting the demon to storm off in rage. Meanwhile, Halfbie awoke to another bout of unexplained sickness and a vivid dream of stealing a dragon’s necklace—only for Mordecai’s magic to backfire, waking the dragon in a fit of paranoia. With fast thinking and absurd deception, Mordecai convinced the dragon that Halfbie was a terminally ill Make-A-Wish recipient, inadvertently causing Halfbie to believe they were dying. This sent them spiraling into an existential crisis, during which they hastily drafted a bucket list, including opening a soup shop and saving the world.

To clear Halfbie’s mind, The Korrigan teleported them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], where they reunited with the elderly Jessamine, a figure from Halfbie’s past. Over weeks of quiet farm life, Halfbie rekindled their love for chicken noodle soup and took care of Jessamine, only to wake one morning and find her gone, with only a handwritten recipe left behind. Halfbie wandered for what felt like 500 years before finally returning to Korrigan, who barely registered their absence. Upon returning to the material world, they discovered a note from Obeus, who had mysteriously left, leading them to head toward Blackwall. Along the way, they stumbled into a funeral for Karnal, a famed adventurer, and pledged to avenge his death against the orc Wartooth before continuing their journey.

Blackwall, however, was almost unrecognizable, transformed by The Hero Cult’s influence, with The Party practically deified by its members. Unsettled, they were directed to Steve Ulan and Keith Horrigan, who had orchestrated the OFC’s expansion, building infrastructure and imprisoning racists in underground tunnels. Their policies, though efficient, raised moral concerns, leading to an argument about ethics. Korrigan insisted on freeing a captured harpy, only for chaos to erupt when Aidan, who had wandered off, was suddenly possessed by Chronovorus. In a brutal display, he began indiscriminately killing civilians before the group intervened. A coordinated effort between Mordecai, Drache, and Halfbie successfully subdued Aidan with a well-placed Sleep spell, leaving the city in stunned silence as the possessed rogue fell unconscious.

# Full Session Notes
As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] slowly woke up, they tried to piece together what had happened the previous night[^1]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was still looking in horror at his new husband, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Bronumas, The Devourer\|Bronumas, The Devourer]], tried to quickly come up with a reason why they could not be married anymore. But as he asked some clarifying questions, the demon revealed that they would never get a divorce otherwise, his brother would come and beat [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] up. They weren't intimidated until the demon showed them a terrifying picture of his brother: A vast and terrifyingly strong-looking demon[^2], which dashed any thoughts of getting a divorce. That was until [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] came up with a lie that he actually was already married and, therefore, their marriage wasn't legitimate, but before he could apologise, the demon called him an Asshole before storming off into a portal back to hell. 

The commotion of this woke up [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who had apparently thrown up while they were asleep again. Taking pity on the [[Eladrin\|Eladrin]] since they had told them to go back to sleep, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] used Prestidigitation to clean their vomit. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thanked them before explaining how they had the weirdest dream of them stealing some necklace from a dragon, but they were cut off halfway when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to cast Tasha's Hideous Mockery on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. even in their groggy state, they were able to cast off the spell and inadvertently pushed the effects onto [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], who instantly started laughing uncontrollably loud. Much to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s dismay, the laughing began to stir the dragon. 

Without being able to stop, their laughing woke up the dragon, who quickly realised that their necklace was missing. Thankfully for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], the dragon was incredibly hungover and didn't recognise him or [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/The Barista Dragon\|The Barista Dragon]] approached [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asked if they had seen or knew where their lost amulet was. unaware of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s thievery, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] explained that they had no idea where it was, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had the Locate Object spell and could quickly find it if they had a detailed description of it. The dragon was happy to provide one. 

Using a variety of abilities to free themselves from the spell and convince the dragon that they were telling the truth, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was a Make-A-Wish kid and didn't actually have any magic. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who had no idea what Make-A-Wish was, said, "Oh, how rude of me; I haven't introduced myself; I'm [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]", as they reached out their hand to the dragon to shake. Unfortunately, as they did so, they threw up, which was the last thing the dragon needed to convince him of. However, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s lie was good enough that it convinced the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], who all felt incredibly bad for them. 

The dragon was less than impressed and, after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested to try [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]'s lost property office, left them to their business. Meanwhile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] what Make-A-Wish was. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained that it was a scheme that helped young people who were dying achieve their wishes, like meeting a celebrity or something similar. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s face dropped as they exclaimed, "I HAVE CANCER?!?" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to explain that this wasn't the case, but none of them were convinced. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], for their part, got out a notebook and started writing out their bucket list, which was:
1. Open a chicken noodle soup shop 
2. Make a clothing brand
3. Save the world with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Fatebreakers]] 

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was nearly in tears at this point, said that they could go to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and open the shop there. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] insisted that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't have Cancer, which only convinced them that they had "Death Disease". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say something else, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stepped in, saying that he had a way to make [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] feel better. They said they would be more than happy to have a distraction, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] teleported both of them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] waited in the [[Locations/Feywild/Temple of Lorwyn\|Temple of Lorwyn]] while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] found themselves in front of the familiar wooden shake in [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]]. They tentatively approached and knocked on the door, and the beautiful [[Eladrin\|Eladrin]] they once knew was now very old, she instantly recognised them and invited them in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that they said they would return before asking what their name was they now realise they never got it when they were last here. She laughed before introducing herself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]]. 

Walking into the hut, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was greeted with a wave of memories returning to them of their last time in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. These memories were joined by the familiar scent of chicken noodle soup, and before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could process the memory, they asked if they could have a bowl of it. Jessamine laughed before giving them a large bowl of the soup. they gratefully accepted and tucked in.  Unfortunately, the soup wasn't as nice as they had remembered [^3], prompting them to ask if she had changed the recipe. She hadn't. 

She reached for her own bowl, but as she did, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] heard many of the bones in her body crunch and groaned in pain. She explained that with her old age, everything was becoming a lot harder. she explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was more than welcome to stay with her for as long as they liked, but they would have to do so chores around the house like last time. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was more than happy to do so and instantly cleaned the house of dust with magic. She nodded in approval before taking them to the farm outside, where she asked him to clean out the chicken coop while she started picking various vegetables from the ground with much difficulty. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] started cleaning out the coop, and without thinking, they asked the chickens to move out of the way so they could get the eggs as well. The chicken moved and said, "Yorp". [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thanked them with the chicken, simply saying "Yorp" again. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained how it was nice to be in a nice environment like this and have support from Jessamine and the chickens; looking up and asking for confirmation, the chicken simply said "Yorp" again, which made [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] smile. 

They continued their work as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] returned inside. before they got out of earshot, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] explained that they would find a way to elevate their back pain so they would have an easier time. She thanked him before returning inside. Soon, hours turned into days, then days into weeks and over time, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] became much more enthusiastic about the chicken noodle soup again, as it was one of the few nutritious meals [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] could make in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. 

They spent a long time together as they spent their days peacefully working the farm and animals. One day, she asked them why they returned to her cabin after waiting for so long. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they weren't in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], and time seemed to floor differently here. for them, it has been a week at most. they also explained how they had caught a disease called the death disease, and they wanted to re-tune and say a proper goodbye. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] commented on how death did come for them all [^4]. 

One day, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] woke up and couldn't find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] anywhere. She didn't return his calls, and after a while, they became quite worried for her. They finally checked her room and found it empty; however, strangely, her clothes were crumpled on the floor like they had been worn one moment and then suddenly fell off her as she had disappeared. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was incredibly saddened by this and went into autopilot as they began the daily chores. it wasn't until much later that they finally worked up the courage to return to the room and sort her things. Looking through her clothes on the floor, they found a note and began to cry as they read it; it was the chicken noodle soup recipe. Feeling strange about having such strong emotions on a note 

With nothing left in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], they left the hut and set the animals free. They walked through [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]] for 500 years before finding [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] again. For him, it had only been a few hours, and he was enjoying his own chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]s approached, their youth returning as they walked closer to their friend. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asked if they were ok, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] explained their experience with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] and 500 of walking. When hearing how long they had been walking, they exclaimed that this was good as the death disease hadn't killed them yet. 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked a little better after hearing this before quoting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] saying that "death disease does for us all". looking very concerned, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asked if it was contagious before using the flora on the ground to push [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] back. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], for their part, tried to fight the movement by speed walking forward [^5]. They soon convinced [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] that it wasn't contagious and were allowed to rejoin him before they teleported back to the material plane.

Returning, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suddenly realised that in the note they had left [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], they said they would meet her in the pub in the morning, but it was now past lunch. He ran to the pub, using his magic to propel him quickly to his destination. He reached the pub startlingly quickly and asked the barkeeper if he knew if a young half-elf had stopped by. The barkeep said he had no idea, but maybe some [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] could help him remember. the barkeep asked for 15 [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]], but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] put 20 on the counter. the barkeep explained she had been at the pub for half an hour or so before leaving. she left a note that simply read, "I'm sorry, I knew".

Returning to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained everything to them, and with little else they could do, they decided to head for [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and see if they could find her along the way. They finally left [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] and had an extremely good time. Along the way, they heard some strange singing; [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] sent [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bobs\|Bobs]] to investigate and learnt that it seemed like people were dancing around a fire. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] sarcastically asked if they should say hi, to which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sarcastically replied that they should. Missing the sarcasm, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says "OK!" before running over to say hi before the others could stop them. 

Approaching, they found the people were all dancing around a fire which was burning a body. Now they were closer; they could hear that the song was praising someone's life, which was when it clocked that this was a funeral. They approached awkwardly, asking if they could join and learn about what they were doing. the group enthusiastically invented them and the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to join them.

They explained that they were holding a funeral for their friend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]], who had recently been killed by an [[Orcs\|orc]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been everywhere in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], "from [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the [[Locations/The Desert/Broken Ember Throne\|Broken Ember Throne]]," impressing everyone. they then revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been involved in many of the world's recent events, including [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], and even joined the hunt for a missing [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]][^6].  Seeing that it was getting a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] excused themselves, not before promising to get revenge for them if they ever ran into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]] on their travels. Before leaving, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] performed a funeral rite for them and sent the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]]'s soul to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s as he felt that this would be the best place for a person who loves adventure.

They soon arrived in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], where they were confronted by a town that had radically changed since they had last visited. all of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] banners had been replaced by white and [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] banners. the population was now incredibly diverse, and many of them were wearing the [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] and white rope of [[Groups & Factions/The Hero Cult\|The Hero Cult]]. Walking through the town, some of the robbed members bowed low, with many of them fangirling if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] looked at them for a moment more or tried to ask them questions. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] were very uncomfortable with this but soon saw there was nothing they could do but order them to direct them to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. The cult guided them there, with many rushing ahead to clear the paths and roads to line by the door like a king's guards would. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] what they thought about all of this, to which she said she thought of something very funny. before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could ask, they took control of the body and made them float in the air before letting a large wave of fire erupt from their hands. Horrified, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] had taken over and caused that because she thought it would be funny. They quickly ran inside before more people started staring at them. they were guided up the stairs and into the councillor's office, where [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] sat. Keith had his feet on the desk while Steve, who was wearing a white and [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] clock and holding a shepherd crook, was standing reading a document at a table. When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] walked, they immediately rose to attention.

They demanded to know what had happened. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] quickly recounted the events since they last left the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Apparently, they ran out of space in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], so they moved to another town in the nation, including [[Locations/OFC/Firebranch Range\|Firebranch Range]] and [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], but quickly outgrew those as well. each time, they would upgrade the infrastructure of the town before moving, so all of those towns now have fixed buildings and even defensive walls. They soon got to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], where they renovated all of the buildings and even started using the tunnels under [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|The Black Tower]] to hold all the racists. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] had apparently tried to stop the worship of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] but couldn't make people less interested in the worship and made them refuse to stop. at one point, they found a Harpie, which they trapped in the dungeons, which helped them with healing people who got sick or hurt. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] was out of breath at this point, so [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] stepped in to give him a breath. 

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] congratulated him and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] on almost single-handedly running a nation, although not very ethically. After a lengthy lecture from [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] about ethics. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] demanded to see the Harpie. They were quickly led to the new dungeons where many people were sat in cells and forced to talk to other [[Other Information/Races/Races\|races]]. at the end of the cells was a room covered in blood where the harpie was kept chained to the wall. it threatened to kill all of them until [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained how he was going to free them. Once freed, it flew out of the dungeon incredibly quickly. 

Before they could do anything, they heard a loud bang and a lot of screams. Almost on impulse, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ran towards the screams with exasperated [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] struggling to keep up behind them. Running onto the streets, they found a possessed [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], who must have snuck away at some point when entering the city, now possessed by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who was firing beams of energy aimed to kill as many people as possible with at least a dozen already dead around him.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to cast Dispel Magic but was unsuccessful this time. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] came up with a plan: if people could weaken him, then he could cast sleep on [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]]'s body and put him to knock him out. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] immediately jumped into action and fired a powerful bolt of magic, which was enough for the sleep spell to take hold. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] fell unconscious, plummeting to the ground. 

The silence was deafening.
