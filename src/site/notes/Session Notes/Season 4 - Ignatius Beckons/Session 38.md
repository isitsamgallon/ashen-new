# Session Summary 
Fleeing from the Tulan Fort atop [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]]’s giant ice spider, the Party was nearly caught—until Halfbie used their Tome of Unfinished Stories to subtly rewrite reality, turning their would-be captors into vaguely disappointed bureaucrats. After being allowed to leave, Halfbie was suddenly struck by a poisoned arrow engraved with the name “Dave McDuffin.” Chenris, speaking through Halfbie, recognised it as a rare and lethal “Name Poison.” The group continued their journey until they encountered a bone-carved funeral carriage pulled by a stitched-together ox and flanked by robed, faceless attendants. A coffin marked “Do Not Open” sat atop the carriage.

Compelled by a divine sense of ritual and foreboding magic, Chenris (through Halfbie) rang a rusted bell offered by one of the attendants. This unleashed a fragment of a dead god, which forced itself into Halfbie’s body, seemingly possessing them. Korrigan’s attempt to track the carriage failed as its trail vanished into the mist, but the Party quickly realised the possession was not just symbolic—it was the incubation of a divine entity. That night, they were surrounded by vampires who offered food and claimed they served an ancient god named Vaelrith, who predated even Aetherion, and now lived within Halfbie.

What followed was a horrific campaign of magical consumption. Halfbie was led through portals to devour entire taverns’ worth of food, silos of grain, and even livestock, much to Korrigan’s anguish. The vampires insisted this “feeding” was necessary to sustain and bring forth their god. Korrigan, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]], and Mordecai prepared for an operation to extract Vaelrith from Halfbie’s body. The next morning, the skies turned black and ominous bells tolled—the ritual had begun.

Korrigan cut into Halfbie’s stomach, unleashing a tide of black pus and, eventually, Vaelrith himself—an eerie, skeletal figure birthed from ichor. After being handed the cursed bell by Halfbie, Vaelrith disappeared into thin air, leaving behind only silence. The Party, horrified and exhausted, barely had time to react before Xekai appeared via portal, offering a cryptic yet bitterly amused commentary on the events. The aftermath left the group shaken—especially Mordecai, who chastised Halfbie for their reckless curiosity that nearly got them all killed.

# Full Session Notes 
(x:: [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], still on the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] with her giant ice spider, hurried to escape from [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. They could hear shouts and screams from within the fort as they rushed to raid for the chaise. While [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] panicked and attempted to devise a plan to get out of this situation, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly took out their [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and began casting a spell to rewrite aspects of the world. The spell changed the problem so that the people in the fort were no longer angry with them and were willing to offer a choice. )

(x:: As the members of the fort caught up with them, everything slowed down, and the fort members gave them a stern but light reprimand. They explained that spying was bad and that riding on the back of a giant ice spider could lead to a cold, so they needed to be more careful.)

(x:: [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] played along until they were allowed to leave. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly cast the Message spell as each group parted ways to contact one of the Gods, reminding them they could unionise and deserved better. Turning to their friends, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaimed that they should unionise, only to be abruptly shot in the shoulder with a poisoned arrow by a commander who shouted, "NO UNIONISING!!" Intrigued by the fast-acting poison, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] discreetly grabbed the arrow as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] began to leave the area.)

(x:: Examining the arrow, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] couldn't identify the poison but noticed that the name "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Dave McDuffin †\|Dave McDuffin †]]" was engraved on the shaft. Sensing some magic on the arrow, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over the analysis. However, they could only determine that it was enchanted. CXhenris, on the other hand, immediately recognised it from an old class at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] as a "Name Poison," a technique from [[Locations/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] that creates especially deadly poisons targeted at a specific person. The arrow would not affect anyone else and could not be replicated. Chenris shared this knowledge with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who explained it to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], much to their surprise.)

(x:: After some travelling, they made excellent progress until they reached the old wall separating [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]] from the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. The wall was not well-maintained, with much of it severely eroded or completely missing in some areas. Most of the Dawn flags had also been taken down and replaced with the emblem of The [[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood Of The Sun]]. Seeing the symbol reminded [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis Ignithar]] and his promise to teach them magic. They pulled out the magic bell they had given him and rang it. The metal of the bell reshaped into a face and said, "You are currently number 698 in the queue," before switching to [hold music](https://open.spotify.com/track/35oiHtaPcjzqwx2gu9dx6a?si=0bb51f545de94ab3). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they should call back another time, but as they spoke, a distant, hollow toll echoed through the fog-choked air—a deep and resonant bell ringing with sorrow that clung to the bones.)

(x:: From their vantage point, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] was the first to spot it—a silhouette emerging slowly through the mist. A towering funeral carriage, ghostly white and creaking like splintering wood, rolled forward at a steady, unnatural pace. It was pulled by a hulking, two-headed ox, each head bobbing out of sync with the other. Its patchwork body was a grotesque tapestry of stitched-together beasts. Fur gave way to feather, then to scaled hide, all roughly sewn with thick, ancient threads stained dark with age and blood.)

(x:: Flanking the carriage were two figures draped head to toe in tattered black robes. The heavy fabric completely obscured their faces, and not a single movement betrayed the presence of life beneath. No footsteps could be heard—only the slow grind of bone wheels over frost-bitten dirt.)

(x:: [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] stepped back instinctively, unsure whether to flee or freeze. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], with a shiver, knelt beside the road and lit a small candle. The others followed suit, mimicking a ritual they didn't understand but somehow knew was right. Silent respect—or perhaps fear—tied their hands.)

(x:: As the carriage drew closer, the true horror began to unveil itself. What had first appeared as an ivory-painted cart was, in truth, constructed entirely from bones—thousands of them, cracked and yellowed, lashed together into a latticework of death. Skulls of [[Humans\|Humans]], [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]], [[Other Information/Races/Dwarves\|dwarves]], and even things no one could name formed grotesque ornamentation across the chassis. Rib cages formed wheels, spine columns ran the length like support beams, and long, clawed fingers clutched the casket above as if trying to drag something back in.)

Atop the carriage sat a coffin, its wood so weathered it looked liable to crumble at a breath. It bore no seals or runes, only a frantic scrawl gouged into the lid: Do Not Open. This was the desperate final plea of someone who died, knowing what might follow.

The ox snorted—one head letting out a low, rattling groan like a tomb being opened—and the caravan halted. At once, the robed figures stopped. Perfectly. Simultaneously. Not a breath, not a shift, not even the creak of fabric.

Then, with slow, deliberate movement, the figure closest to the group extended a gloved hand. In its grasp was a rusted iron bell, crusted in places with dark, old blood. It held it outstretched toward them—but did not speak. It did not move. It simply was.

The silence was unbearable. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] cleared their throat and tried to speak, but the words died in their mouth. Aidan shifted uneasily, and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s grip tightened on his weapon. The only sound was the wind through the trees—and the faint hum of something old watching from the shadows.

While the others tried vainly to question the figures, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s eyes glazed as their magical senses flared. The coffin behind the ox radiated something terrible—raw, divine energy fractured and fouled. It was the kind of power they had only felt once before: in the presence of a god. And something about it was wrong.

Deep within [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s mind, another presence stirred—an old soul with too many regrets. Chenris. His voice was a whisper of steel. "That's no god... Not anymore. It's a fragment. A dead piece of divinity. And to rest it, you'd need consecrated soil."

His tone turned grim. "There's no consecrated soil left in this cursed world."

Taking control, Chenris forced [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s body forward, his voice low and cold, cutting through the unnatural quiet. "How do you intend to bury a god... When the earth itself has forgotten how to bless the dead?"

The figure did not reply.

Instead, it moved the bell closer—hovering inches from [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s chest.

Chenris didn't flinch. He reached out, grasped the handle, and, with a measured breath... Rang it once.

The toll was devastating. The sound shouldn't have carried—but it echoed across the hills, vibrating in the marrow of their bones. The mist grew still. The ox stopped breathing. Time itself seemed to halt for a heartbeat—

And then it happened.

The coffin burst open.

A black shape—like a shadow too thick for light to penetrate—lurched from within, howling silently as it launched toward [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. It passed through Chenris' presence like a blade, tearing him loose from the body with a screech of psychic static.

Then it settled inside [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].

Their posture straightened, and their expressions went blank. A low hum vibrated in the air around them, a static charge that raised the hairs on everyone's arms.

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] stepped forward cautiously. "[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]...? Are you—" He didn't finish. The moment his hand touched their shoulder, a violent shock of psychic energy sent him reeling back, clutching his head and gasping in pain.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] reacted instantly, casting [[Admin/Spells/Dispel Magic\|Dispel Magic]]. But it fizzled uselessly against the invader's power. The presence inside [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] remained undeterred.

Panicked, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] barked at [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. "Watch them. Don't let them do anything."

He sprinted down the road, following the path the carriage had taken, but the tracks... Ended within minutes as if the entire procession had never existed. The mist was thicker now, and the oppressive weight of magic lingered in the air like smoke after a fire. Familiar. Too familiar.

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] clenched his fists.

This wasn't a random encounter.

It was a message.

A warning dressed in ritual, wrapped in silence and bound in death.

And it was meant for them.

He soon returned to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who seemed relatively normal, and explained that they didn't feel very different from what they usually did. If anything, they felt quite powerful and confident—a statement that terrified [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] as that was what they experienced when Seifer Willow began possessing them. They explained this to the group, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reassured them that they don't hear any voices in their heads, so it's probably something different. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to ask Seifer if they knew anything, but she refused to tell them anything more than it was God they had not encountered yet and 'they' would be looking for them. She cackled when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pleaded for her to explain what she meant. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it would be best to set up camp as it was getting dark anyway. They went into the nearby fairest, with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] covering all of their tracks as they went, and found a secluded spot for them to sleep. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they were sure their Leomunds Tiny Hut spell prevented almost everything from entering it. They soon had the spell up, and the other decided it would be best to take shifts watching [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make sure nothing bad happened. 

After writing some notes in their book, they fell asleep, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was on the first shift. Everything was quiet for hours until [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] heard a stick snap outside the barrier. The barrier was one way so that they could see out, but no one could see in. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was on high alert before a rock was thrown at the barrier, pining off harmlessly. They quickly jolted [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] awake, and he was wide awake. As they scanned their environment, a humanoid walked out of the darkness and sat in front of the dome. Then another came out of the darkness, and then another until they were sounded by about 50 of these people. Most of them were dressed in black, expensive clothing or looked like they came from noble families. Finally, a tall woman walked through the sea of people; behind her were the four vampires who [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] met in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]].

The women walked confidently to the dome, their vampiric features on full display to those with dark vision. From within the dome, they asked what a large group of vampires wanted. The women simply stated that they wished to feed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and that they would wait all night if they had to. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked them why they needed to feed them and if they had chicken noodle soup. The women, now frustrated, said they wanted to ensure [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and their God survived what was to come. 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] manipulated the dome so the vampires could see them and moved closer to the vampires. They told them to put the food on their floating disk as they conjured forth Tensor's Floating Disk and pushed it through the dome. As this happened, Kerrigan sneakily cast his [[Admin/Spells/Detect Thoughts\|detect thoughts]] spell and exited the doom to talk to them face-to-face and see what he could learn. No matter his questions, the women would not explain who they were and what their God was. She seemed aware that her mind was being read and gave away no clues. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] knew when he was beaten and stopped the spell. While this was happening, the vampires quickly piled on as much food as they could onto the disk, with the women putting on a large ornate meat pie on top and pushing it back in. 

As the food approached, it began to rapidly age and rot away until nothing but sludge was left. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used disinfection to clean the disk in case anything got on their stuff. The vampires stood up again, holding even more rich and expensive food and putting iot on the disk again. 

When [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asks, the women explain that they heard about [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] from the [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|vampire]] kids, who had been following them. The food they carried was whatever they could bring, and they had little time to prepare, but they would soon bring more. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thanked them, still slightly confused, before asking who the God was. The woman was now quite irritated but saw she wouldn't get anywhere until she explained this to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] and said she would tell them if they didn't speak his name in their presence as they were unworthy. 

(x:: With a kind smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that if they told them that, she could come into the dome. She nodded and said their God was called '[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]', and he was an ancient god. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asked if they were related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], and the women explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was much older than Aetheorion. Entering the doom and sitting down, she explained that for Aetheorion, the God of life, to die, the concept of death needed to exist. [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was that concept. Kerrigan began to say they were good friends of the Terathera, but the women didn't seem to care. )

(x:: Each of the large and luxurious plates of food was 'eaten.' The vampires explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was now acting almost like an Egg for their God and implied this was only possible because the Skyward Barrier had weakened. Once the food was all eaten, the women opened up a large black portal, similar to the ones [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] made. On the other side, a very confused tavern could be seen. Much to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s dismay, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began walking to the portal. They tried to tell them to reconsider their actions, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] rebutted, saying that if they wanted to, the vampires could've killed them by now, but they hadn't. The women explained that although they wished for their God, they wanted to do it without their friend dying. Halfbies and women soon walked through the portal, followed quickly by the rest of the vampires and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]]. )

Inside the tavern, the woman walked straight to the barkeep and told him to bring out all the food he had in the building before slamming a large sack of coins on the table. The man blinked before running to the kitchen. They all sat at the bar. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] approached, asking if they would have to be midwives for [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. The lad laughed and explained that they didn't. All they had to do was ensure it was fed and cut out of [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s stomach. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to hide their worry, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] noticed and explained that most had good healing spells. So it would be fine.

The bartender soon returned a lot of food, which quickly vanished into sludge in front of them. The bartender, looking quite defeated, began to clean his bar until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], feeling bad for him, cleaned it with their magic. 

Afterwards, the lady asked if [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] drank blood wine, to which they said, "Not typically. Is it like Absinthe? Will it make me a [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|vampire]] if I drink blood?" the lady smirked before asking if they wanted to be a [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|vampire]]. Before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could answer, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] shouted 'No'. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said they would love to have some of the wine and give it away. Unlike all other food and drink, the wine didn't disappear, allowing them to drink it. 

Slightly worried, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they could ever eat and drink regular food again. The lady explained that everything would return to normal in a few hours or so once the God had been born. 

Soon, they were done in the tavern, and the lady opened a portal into what looked like a large indoor farmer's market. Much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]]'s dismay, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was told they had to consume everything, or they would die. So, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] begrudgingly walked around the marketing, destroying every bit of food in the room.

Next, the lad teleported them to a very large grain silo. "Go on, I'm afraid you already know what must happen." [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast the FLy spell on them and slowly lowered themselves into the silo, destroying months and months' worth of the village's food supply. They did the same for the rest of the silos before flying over all of the crops to absorb them as well. They repeated this process at other nearby farms before coming to one that dealt in livestock. At this point, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] lost it. He refused to let them take an animal's life. Instead, he summoned a large amount of brambles with berries on them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] absorbed all of them, draining [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] of all his magics. The vampires explained it wasn't enough and they needed the cows. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] promised that it would be quick and painless for the animals. They agreed, and soon [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stood over sludge and mould where animals once were. 

After all of this, Haklfbie was emotionally drained, mesially destroying a village's food supply for the next few years. He collapsed on the floor after exiting the last portal. They were in a wide-open field. Dawn was fast approaching, so the vampires decided to take their leave. They left, explaining that they would know when it was time and that they would have to cut the God out of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s stomach. 

(x:: While leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to get some rest, the other came up with a plan. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] found an herb commonly used as an anaesthetic during operations. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] practised the cuts using the claws he had got from his primary savagery ability. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was encouraged to make sure [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was okay during the process while helping. )

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awoke to their stomach growling and filled with slight pain. Upon hearing this, everyone got into action and began applying the anaesthetic to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they lay on the floor shirtless, looking incredibly worried. 

As the sun rose over the ashen cliffs, the golden warmth of dawn was quickly devoured. In a matter of seconds, the sky blackened, as if a curtain of shadow had been pulled over the heavens. Winds howled to life, shrieking like dying spirits through the trees, and far in the distance, ancient bells began to toll—a slow, mournful chime that echoed like a funeral dirge across the hills.

The ritual had begun.

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] knelt over [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s unconscious form, his face pale and taut with tension. His claws shimmered with a faint druidic light as he steadied his trembling hands. Around them, a circle of protective runes flickered on the ground—wards hastily cast, shielding them from what they could only hope was enough.

"Here we go," [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] muttered to himself, and plunged his claws into [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s stomach.

The incision opened not with blood, but with something far worse. A wave of thick, bubbling black pus erupted from the wound, gushing out in steaming torrents like sludge from a ruptured sewer. The smell hit instantly—decay, sulphur, rot. The kind of stench that lived in nightmares.

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] recoiled for a split second before leaping into action, summoning a flurry of white-gloved hands made of spectral magic to begin scooping the foul ichor away. Her face was fixed in a mask of horror and determination. Every scoop of the pus dissolved like tar into the soil, hissing and burning the ground. It wasn’t just filth—it was wrong.)

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] widened the wound, muttering apologies under his breath as more and more of the vile substance spilled out—an impossible amount. It was like trying to drain a bottomless pit. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] knelt beside [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], whispering softly to them, words of comfort and reassurance, their voice shaking. But [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] couldn’t hear. Their eyes were open, glassy and unfocused, and even if they had heard [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s words, there was nothing left inside to answer.

Then [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] froze.

His breath caught in his throat as he leaned in, squinting into the pit he had carved in [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s gut. There, nestled deep in the impossible depths of the body, something bone-white gleamed.

A skull.

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]’s claws retracted as he reached inside, hesitating for only a moment before gripping it. The cavity was far too deep—it defied all sense of anatomy. As he pulled, the skull rose slowly, almost willingly, as though it wanted to be seen.

Then it began to move.

The skull jerked free of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s body and hovered mid-air, rotating slowly. Black pus began to congeal around it, forming a long, flowing mantle that hung in the air like oil-stained velvet. Arms grew from the mire—thin, impossibly long, ending in skeletal hands. The rest of the body emerged, shaped by the very pus that had infected [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s form, until the entity hovered fully formed, draped in shadow, floating above the open wound like a death omen.

It turned its eyeless sockets toward [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], and in a voice that chilled bone, it whispered:

"Father... Please hand me the bell."

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], dazed and twitching, reached into their satchel with a trembling hand. Without understanding why, they placed the bell in the creature’s waiting palm.

“Thank you,” the figure said, almost politely.

Then it looked up toward the sky. The wind died in an instant. Not even the leaves rustled.

And just like that, it was gone—vanished into nothing.

The world held its breath.

The bells had stopped. The clouds stilled. The air, heavy with the scent of rot and magic, was deathly quiet.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s voice finally broke the silence, a hoarse whisper. “What... What the fuck have we done?”

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] didn’t answer. There was no time. He barked orders to anyone who could still move. “Heal him! Now! I’ve got nothing left!”

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], eyes fluttering with returning awareness, forced themselves upright. Blood still trickled from their gut, but their fingers sparked with life as they summoned a healing spell that surged through their torn abdomen, sealing the flesh with a golden glow.

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] sat in stunned silence, each of them trying to make sense of what had just happened. No one spoke until [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], still pale, leaned in.

"Well? What did you learn?"

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] coughed weakly, managing a strained chuckle. “That maybe vampires aren’t so bad after all?”

“That’s not funny,” [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] snapped. “You don’t touch cursed objects.”

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to explain, their voice small and unsure. “It didn’t seem cursed... I mean, the bell wasn’t that bad... I just—needed to know.”

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood, furious now. “Your curiosity is going to get us all killed! You keep chasing the mystery and we pay the price. You can’t keep doing this, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. You can’t.”

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked down, shame flickering behind their eyes. “I’ll be more careful next time.”

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], rubbing his temples, muttered, “Maybe we should tell the shadow-fox about this.”

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighed. “Knowing him? He probably already—”

A crack split the air.

A purple portal shimmered open behind them, humming with unstable energy. From its centre stepped a tall figure in dark robes, his fox mask cracked with irritation. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]].

His eyes, glowing with that unearthly light, settled on the group.

“They’re going to die anyway,” he said flatly, surveying the scene with distaste. “Why not be a little curious?”
