# Session Summary 
The session began with Haldir Heleyarus revealing the truth behind each party member, using a powerful spell to strip them of illusions and divine influences. The Korrigan lost his [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] magic and returned to his human form, Aidan Knight lost his connection to Chronovorus, and Halfbie was confronted by the ghost of Chenris Tallfellow. The revelation sent Halfbie into a panic, struggling with an overwhelming sense of familiarity with Chenris, while Korrigan suffered a violent breakdown as suppressed memories surged back, leading him to declare his intent to kill the King of Lost Haven. Mordecai and Drache tried to rein in their companions, while Chenris, now a ghost, struggled to reconnect with the group, leading to an unsettling confrontation about Halfbie’s true nature.

Before they could process these revelations, Haldir exposed one final deception—[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] had been carrying an Aspect of Ebis Daro within her. The Aspect violently separated from her, igniting a battle that pushed the party to their limits. Fireballs and lightning tore through the chamber as the Aspect shifted forms, first as a spectral warrior and later as a dragon. The fight was grueling, with Drache and Halfbie unleashing devastating attacks, while Mordecai’s wild magic surged unpredictably. The final blow was dealt in a combined effort, shattering the Aspect into mist, but not before it nearly claimed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]]' life. As the dust settled, Chenris harshly questioned [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] about her connection to Ebis Daro, reducing her to tears before Mordecai and Korrigan reprimanded him.

Haldir, unimpressed with their chaotic battle, dismissed them, and as they exited his chambers, they reverted to their usual forms. However, to their horror, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was missing—left behind as the portal shut. They left a message for her before drowning their frustrations in alcohol at a Strixhaven tavern, leading to an absurd night of heavy drinking, karaoke, and an unexpected awakening on the university’s sports field. Mordecai, regaining an old stolen necklace from a passed-out dragon, tried to cover up his theft, but Halfbie’s drunken recollection almost exposed him. Meanwhile, Korrigan realized, to his absolute dread, that in his drunken state, he had botched a summoning ritual, accidentally binding himself to a demon named Bronumas, The Devourer—who now believed they were engaged.

# Full Session Notes
[^1] [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] raised his hands before exclaiming that everyone had been lying, and it was time to stop that. With that, a large wave of magic sprung from his fingertips, causing everyone to reveal their actual forms: 
- [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] lost his antlers and his [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] magics and returned to being a regular human. 
- [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] remained unchanged but now had the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder. 
- [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also remained the same but now had the ghost of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] standing next to them. 
- [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] lost his connection to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and all of his time manipulation abilities. 
- [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] remained entirely the same as he had not made any deals with Gods or was possessed 

#### The Return of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]
(x:: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]". )

(x:: Taken back, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained even if they had a sword, they wouldn't have given him one because of how strange they were acting, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] seconded this. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] realised this and backtracked a little, explaining he also needed to go there to destroy [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], but more importantly, Chenis was here, and he jumped up to say 'Hi' to his old friend, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] didn't respond. With a warty glance at Chneris, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed to the still-panicking [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and tried to help them calm down and introduce [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]]. Explaining that they well may already know of them, but this is their old friend who died recently, and as much as they hated to admit it, they all really missed him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a long look at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] before stating "Y- y-y- eah, why does it feel like i know him, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]? Why does he feel like a part of me, a part I cannot escape no matter where I run to?")

Looking at the [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] with pity, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was at a loss for words. staring at Chenis with suspicion, they explained that none of them really knew what was happening to them right now. Addressing the ghost, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaims, "Why is it when I look at you, I see everything I’m afraid of becoming? But what if it’s already too late? What if I’m already you?" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]'s usually stern face softened, but before he could say anything, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] interjected and explained that although [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] are similar in some ways with their relentless drive for learning and being nerds, they were nothing like [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] as they were kind and compassionate and caring for others, a skill the man in front of them lacked until maybe the very end.

(x:: [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris']] eyebrow raised before he finally spoke up, "You know I'm right here, right?". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sarcastically exclaimed, "It seems he speaks?!" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] folded his arms and shifted his weight before exclaiming that although this wasn't how he wanted to meet them, it was still nice to see most of them, finding it quite rude that none had said hello to him. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] exclaimed that it was one of the first things he did, but he never responded. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] denied the human's claims, insisting that none had greeted him. Aidan stepped forward and greeted [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], but he didn't respond. Steeping closer, he asked, "Is that really you? Are you OK?" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] finally turned to Aidan before curtly remarking, "I'm a ghost... no" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't help themselves from letting out a short laugh. Aidan stood for a moment before Saying, "I don't know if you can hear me, but I just wanna say... We may not have always seen eye to eye, but I wanted you to know that I respect the fuck out of you. I regret not being able to tell you that back under [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]." Looking slightly confused, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] replied, "I'm not sure who that is, but don't worry about my sacrifice, it was my way of apologising. Although, it's vexing that I'm still here")

Confused, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked what he meant, and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] explained that when he sacrificed himself, he had hoped he would stay dead and not in his current state of existence. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked why he hadn't tried to reach out or do something, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is smart but can be incredibly dumb at times. Looking almost offended, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] retorted that that wasn't something you say to someone who sacrificed themselves for their friends. He then explained that he didn't feel right interfering with someone else life like that, as it wasn't his.

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suddenly spluttered, "Are you the reason I keep remembering things or having weird dreams?" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] looked at the boy with pity before explaining that those memories were his, but they kept leaking out by accident. He had hoped he could keep it all separate, but something would bleed through when he wasn't careful.

#### The Aspect Of Ebis
(x:: Before they could say anything else, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] cleared his throat with a commanding cough before claiming that it seemed that the spell didn't work for everyone and that there was one more person who wasn't telling the full truth. As he said this, his eyes narrowed to the back of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Following the headmaster's gaze, they found him staring at [[[[Obeus Yelris\|[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] Yelris]], who looked to be on the verge of tears. With a click of his fingers, she let out a scream, she lost all the strength in her legs and crumpled to the floor. As she did so, it looked like a spectral being was being yanked from her. The being crumpled on the floor was small and bony[^2] but wore the same golden mask as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. "Ah, an [[Named Characters & Beasts/Aspect of Ebis Daro\|Aspect of Ebis Daro]], I presume", reasoned the headmaster. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' eyes narrowed in anger at the Empress, but before anyone could say anything, the aspect stood up and began readying a spell.)

The air crackled with energy as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] readied their weapons, every muscle tensed with anticipation. The chamber pulsed with an ominous glow, the shifting mist before them coalescing into a vague humanoid form. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s keen eyes flicked to the gathering energy in the Aspect’s hands—fire, pure and destructive.

“Fireball! Scatter!” they shouted, but the warning came a fraction too late.

A roaring sphere of flame erupted from the Aspect’s outstretched fingers, hurtling toward them at a terrifying speed. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] braced himself, roaring in defiance as the explosion consumed him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] attempted to leap away, but the blast caught them in its fiery embrace, sending them skidding backward across the stone floor, smoke rising from their robes.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], magic suppressed, reacted instantly, his instincts guiding him as he nocked an arrow and fired at the Aspect, the twang of his bowstring lost in the residual crackle of flames. Aidan was just as quick, raising his crossbow and loosing a bolt that shot straight through the spectral mist, while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], ever cautious, muttered an incantation under his breath, summoning a protective sheen of magic around himself.

For a moment, it seemed their combined assault had succeeded—the Aspect wavered, its form crumpling as though collapsing under its own weight. But then, the mist thickened, reformed, twisted into something far more menacing. A towering warrior took shape, its hollow gaze fixed upon them as it let out a guttural, bone-shaking growl.

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], recovering from the previous attack, shot a knowing glance toward [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] before letting out a battle cry of his own. With a furious bellow, he lunged forward, great axe raised high.

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], still singed from the fireball, looked up, their fingers already weaving another spell. But something was different. The incantation twisted, words rearranging themselves in their mind as if guided by an unseen force. The flickering flame in their palms changed, shifting into a crackling sphere of lightning. With a grin, they hurled it forward.

The air split with a deafening roar as the lightning ball detonated, arcing violently through the battlefield. Jagged bolts of energy slammed into the Aspect, forcing it to stumble back as the electricity danced across its spectral form. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] barely managed to twist away from the surge, the hairs on his arms standing on end from the residual energy.

But the Aspect was far from finished. Its voice rumbled through the chamber, ancient and filled with malice as it began to chant. Power surged around it, the very air trembling under the weight of its spell. Then, with a shattering boom, a wave of pure, devastating force exploded outward—Thunderbolt.

The strike tore through the battlefield, barreling toward [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] like an unstoppable force. Without thinking, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] raised a single hand, eyes burning with determination. They spoke, their voice ringing out clear over the chaos. The magic answered.

The moment the spell hit their outstretched arm, it shattered into nothing, vanishing in a flicker of dissipated energy.

The Aspect reeled, momentarily stunned by its failed spell. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] saw the opening and fired, his arrow embedding itself in the creature’s shifting form. Aidan followed with another well-placed bolt, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], seeing the moment of weakness, sent a surge of arcane energy crackling through the mist, forcing the Aspect to falter.

With his allies keeping the creature occupied, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tightened his grip on his great axe, whispering the ancient phrase only he knew. Sparks erupted from the weapon’s edge as it roared to life, imbued with raw, burning energy. With terrifying speed, he surged forward, each strike landing with devastating precision. Two deep, fiery gashes split the Aspect’s form, flames searing into its very essence.

Off to the side, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had been preparing another spell. They knelt, pulling a small box from their robes and activating it with a whispered command. Gears whirred, metal twisted, and in seconds, a turret sprang to life at their feet. With a flick of their fingers, the construct hummed, shifting its targeting focus. It fired. A concentrated blast of raw energy struck the Aspect in the chest, sending it staggering. But before anyone could claim victory, the being collapsed into mist once more—only to reappear moments later in its new form.

A massive dragon.

The spectral beast let out an earth-shaking roar before beating its wings, launching itself backward to gain distance. Its maw opened, crackling with untamed power as it prepared to unleash another devastating Lightning Bolt. Realising the danger, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gritted their teeth and raised a hand, ready to counter. But the dragon had moved—far beyond their range.

The bolt of lightning erupted forward, zigzagging wildly as it sought its targets. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had no time to move—the energy slammed into him, sending him to his knees as his body convulsed with the impact. Further back, Aidan and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] managed to twist away just in time, the outer arcs of the bolt merely grazing them, but still leaving the sting of burnt flesh in its wake. They had to end this, now.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and Aidan raised their bows, firing simultaneously, while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hurled a small mote of fire that exploded across the dragon’s spectral form. As the flames licked at its misty body, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly felt a strange pull in his chest—his wild magic surged. Before he could react, he was floating.

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] ignored the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] now hovering mid-air, his focus solely on the beast before him. He lifted his great axe, feeling the power surge through him once more. With a final, bone-rattling cry, he leapt forward and struck true, the blade carving through the Aspect’s core with lethal precision. As the dragon staggered back, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] activated the turret once more. The tiny machine shifted forms, its barrels rotating as it transitioned from offense to support. A pulse of healing energy burst from its core, surging into [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and mending some of his wounds.

The Aspect, refusing to fall, let out one final, defiant roar and conjured another Fireball, hurling it toward them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] were caught in the explosion. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] emerged, barely fazed, his fury outweighing his pain. But [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] crumpled, motionless.

Something inside [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] snapped.

Arrows and spells rained down in a relentless assault. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], filled with unbridled rage, hacked away at the dragon’s form as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] crafted a powerful enhancement spell, increasing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]’s speed and power. The turret continued its assault, switching between offense and support as needed.

The battle pressed on, fire and lightning clashing in a violent dance of destruction. And then—finally—the Aspect faltered.

With a final, guttural growl, its form shattered. The spectral mist that had plagued them dissipated for good.

The chamber fell silent.

For several moments, none of them moved, waiting to see if the Aspect would return. But after a breathless pause, the realisation set in. It was over. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] exhaled sharply, gripping his axe with shaking hands. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] slumped against their turret, exhausted. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hovered awkwardly in the air, unable to descend yet. While this was happening, Korrigan noticed that Aidan Knight was slumped against the wall unconscious; Korrigan tried to wake him up but had no luck, leaving Drache to carry him out.

#### Leaving The Tower
(x:: They all quickly rushed to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' side as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] began to heal her with magic. She soon woke up, her expression one of shame and embarrassment before anyone could get a word in edgeways, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] looked at her, his expression unreadable as he said, "It seemed the empress had and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] in her pocket, care to explain why?". [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] broke into tears as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] was reprimanded by [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] for being so unkind.)

(x:: The headmaster suddenly spoke up looking dismayed at the chaos his office was now in after the fight. He asked if they had any more questions for him as he was a very busy man and had a lot of work to do. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if had any advice on what they do next. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] snorted and exclaimed that despite his position in a school, he did not teach and therefore didn't care what they did after they left his room. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] snorted at the back of the group but refused to look the headmaster in the eye. The headmaster msued while stroke his beared before telling them to leave if they have nothing else to do or say. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to argue that he let them in to ask question so it seems odd he doesn't care to help them with their next steps. )

The headmaster simply stated that he let them come speak with him because they wanted to speak with him, nothing more nothing less. when asked he also confirmed that once they left his room, they would all return to normal. the spell was just for his room as he didn't want any Gods spying on their conversation. With a stern look he also told them to be a lot more careful with who they spoke to about their plans as they had already reveal a lot to the enemy[^3]. 

(x:: Soon a large golden portal opened and as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] stepped through, they all returned to their normal forms and regained their powers. Outside, they found themselves in a [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] courtyard. Stepping out of the portal [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] soon realised that he had no recollection of what happened after the headmaster's spell was cast leaving [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to wonder if they should tell him what happened as in this situation it seems like ignorance is bliss as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was incredibly angry and sad with all of his memories returned. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was not aware of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s thought process and told him generally what happened before something clicked and they fell quite [^4]. )

(x:: As they were about to leave [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] noticed something: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was missing. as they turned back to the portal they watched in horror as the portal closed with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]] still inside the headmaster's room. With nothing else to do they decide to write a note and have it sent to [[Obeus Yelris]] to tell her they're not mad and they could meet them at the local tavern or at [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. With that they went to the mail room which was located in the teleportation area of the university. )

They found the room relatively quickly. it was filled with letters and packages that a single clerk was desperately trying to organise. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] approached and meekly said that they had a letter to send. The clerk spoke in a gruff voice and was dismayed that he was being given more work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] apologised  for the inconvenience and handed the letter. The clerk asked how they were going to pay the 10 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]] fee, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] turned to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and said "With their money... i guess?"

(x:: Without hesitation, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] put 10 [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] on the table. the clerk smiled and said it would be sent soon. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked how they knew where it needed to as [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had only written "To [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]" on the outside. The clerk said it was magic, and it would know who to send to. With that done [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] led to a small tavern in the residential area of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Along the way, with a sly smile, Mordecai suggested they do shot again, and they were thinking absinthe would be perfect. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was hesitant to agree after how bad their hangover was the last time they drank absinthe. )

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] said, "Fine, well, all order shot, and if you're not brave enough, then I'll drink your one". [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tried to object to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s blatant peer pressuring but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] quick steeled themselves and said they weren't afraid. Once they reached the tavern they all ordered a round of absinthe. they all drank their shots. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] passed out immediately[^5], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] became exceedingly drunk while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wasn't even tipsy. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] thought it would be funny to do some karaoke. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] joined in the fun. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sang incredibly well whilst Korrigan was too drunk to notice that he had shaped into a cat and was just meowing along to the other two. 

(x:: As the night went on, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had even more to drink until they passed out. They awoke in a the Legally distinct Quidditch fields of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Mordecai was the first to wake up, and as their hangover wasn't so bad, they decided to have a look around to see if anything interesting was around. the field was littered with unconscious [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] students , including the dragon that runs the cafe. Surprisingly, the dragon was actually wearing the necklace that Mordecai traded some months ago to cover the cost of Drache's coffee he accidentally ordered[^6]. )

(x:: As they went to steal the necklace, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] woke up with an incredible hangover and asked why it looked like Mordecai was trying to steal from a dragon. Mordecai quick rushed to halfbie to shut them up incase they woke someone up and told them they were dreaming and to go back to bed. halfbie dint complain and went back to sleep. After successfully stealing the neckless, Mordecai work up the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], only to have [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explain how they had such a weird dream of Mordecai trying to steal an old neckless. Mordecai shushed them quickly before dragging them away from the field. Korrigan awoke with only a slight hangover and called out to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]]s and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bobs\|Bobs]] but got no response. He then suddenly remembered how he had tried to resummon them[^7], but because he was too drunk, the summon didn't work correctly. after that his memory is not there. )

(x:: to his horror something responded to his calls, a demon called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Bronumas, The Devourer\|Bronumas, The Devourer]]. who slowly turned over next to him and asked if he wanted anything and when did they want to start planning their wedding. )


# Trivia & Notes
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]] was unavailable for the session but was desperately needed for the combat with the Aspect of Ebis, so [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] played both characters. 
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]] made a joke that [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] shouldn't have their powers as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had forced everyone into their true forms, which removed any power granted by the [[Gods & Heralds/Gods & Heralds\|Gods]]. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] liked the idea and made it the case, much to everyone's horror.
