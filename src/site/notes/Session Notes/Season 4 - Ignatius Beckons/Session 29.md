# Session Summary 
The session began with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] leaving a tavern near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]], marked by [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s first encounter with a hangover, which led to both comedic antics and unexpected teamwork. As they journeyed into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] used his wild shape to scout a secretive meeting in spider form, witnessing the rise of a religious group known as the “[[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood of the Sun]].” The group uncovered leaflets proclaiming loyalty to the "[[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Prince of Fire]]" and debated connections to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' cult. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]’s attempts to gather more information from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow, via [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], provoked anger and unease within the group, highlighting growing tensions.

As the group visited [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|the All-Father Temple]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wrestled with his growing suspicions of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s involvement in [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s mysterious existence. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explored [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]’s room, leading to an elaborate Fey prank that tested [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]’s patience and sanity as he faced surreal, horrifying trials in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Meanwhile, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sought answers in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s chamber, ultimately connecting to her hive mind for information. While unconscious, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed glimpses of Chenris’ persona, hinting at deeper connections between the two.

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] reconvened to reflect on these revelations and sought wisdom in [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]’ and [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]’ domains. Conversations with priests and entities shed light on [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]’ role in maintaining balance and the limitations of killing gods. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s desperation to uncover more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] clashed with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]’s caution, leading to a decision to reject risky deals. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ended the session consulting [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], learning cryptic wisdom about gods, balance, and love, leaving the group with more questions than answers as they prepared to press on.

# Full Session Notes
(x:: As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] prepared to leave the tavern near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]], antics arise with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's first hangover. Noticing the young Eldarin's discomfort, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] decided the most appropriate action for someone complaining that everything was too bright and too loud was to use prestidigitation to create a ringing in his ears to make it all the more uncomfortable for him. Being smarter than [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] ever gave them credit for, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used his own version of the spell to cancel out the effect before rushing over to the tavern keeper, frantically demanding answers as to why he felt so awful when the previous night the gnome had assured him the absinthe was fine to drink. Taking pity on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's naivety, the gnome dug around behind the bar to produce a pair of glasses with dark-tinted lenses. Once they put them on, the world dimmed to a more palatable brightness for his hungover state, providing a mild [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] of comfort to his weakened state. Eventually, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] cast lesser restoration to relieve the symptoms and the shades were gifted to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].)

(x:: As they ventured through [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] couldn't help but muse at how quiet it was compared to the last time they had been there. Chatter could be heard from the largest building, piquing all of their interests and ideas started to be floated about possible infiltration. Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was able to grab their make-up palette, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was keen to experiment further with his new wild shaping ability. Before their very eyes, their fey friend shrunk in size and stature, his humanoid limbs cracking and duplicating in odd angles until all that was left was a spider with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|the Korrigan]]’s signature antlers protruding from his tiny head. As a spider, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] scurried up the walls of the building and squeezed his small form into the tiniest crack in the wall to be an unnoticed witness to whatever large gathering they had stumbled across. )

(x:: The pews inside the building were full to bursting, the entire town gathered under one roof. As [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] watched, three figures clad in yellow and orange robes emerged into the room. Sun motifs danced across their robes in the light of their flaming swords as fire enveloped the stage. An old man emerged from the flames, his beard and robes seemingly untouched by the flames as they dissipated behind him. With surprising strength and dexterity, he wielded a fiery great hammer as he addressed the crowd - stating that before they began their meeting, any citizen not of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the dawn empire]] should leave immediately. Fiery magic emanated from his hammer, licking the walls to find any hidden intruders. The magic swirled around the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|dustwood]] citizens, leaving them unscathed, before finding the spider form of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]. Unable to resist in his minibeast form, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korri]] kept getting pushed further and further back towards the crack in the wall until he was back in the cart with his friends. )

(x:: Once they had determined that the fiery display had ceased, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] crawled back through his trusty crack in the wall and witnessed the secret meeting in its entirety. Once the older man was convinced that the eavesdroppers had been vanquished, he spoke once again, announcing that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|the Emperor]] had “betrayed and abandoned” them. He encouraged the crowd to resurrect the priesthood and bring back their saviour. )

(x:: Once the old man’s spiel had concluded, the priesthood disappeared in an eruption of leaflets that rained down around their audience. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] rushed back to the group, transformed back into his humanoid form, and caught them up on this rogue religious group. The group ventured into the now empty hall to find a couple of leaflets left behind, labelling the group as the “[[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood of the Sun]]” with a tagline of “Remember the [[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Prince of Fire]]”.)
  
(x:: Contemplating the leaflet, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] continued their journey towards [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|the All-father]] Temple. With such fiery motifs, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] couldn’t help but draw comparisons with the group and the cult of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] and asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow if she knew anything about this brotherhood through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]. However, she was less than helpful - claiming that she had never heard of them before. Unconvinced, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] kept pressing her for information, asking her very bluntly how she died. This provoked outrage from the dead woman in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s head, demanding that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] should kill him on the spot for such insensitivity and rudeness. Naturally, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] refused, a little tired of the constant desperation of the woman’s violence towards his party members. )
  
(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly rushed to the door as they arrived and politely knocked before entering. Tourists paused to look at him quizzically before resuming their way through the open double doors of the temple. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked confused in return, as all they knew was that it was polite to knock before entering somewhere, especially somewhere important. Irritated by [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s naïvety, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pushed past him - announcing to the group that he wanted to take [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to see [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] with a glint of contempt in their eye. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was growing desperate for answers, not just about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], but also [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. They were confident that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|she]] was responsible for all this, but why? Why would she go to these lengths? Why was he the only one freaking out? )

#### [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s Room
(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was excited that he could finally share some of his heritage with someone who had no experience with the Fey, practically dragging [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s room. Before entering, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] thought that to give [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] a proper introduction to the Fey, he had to play a prank on the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. He explained that a proper Fey greeting involved clapping three times, turning around, tapping their head, and saying "Oeurrr". [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] seemed sceptical at first, especially when he asked for confirmation; [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then said the sequence in a different order. Nevertheless, he saw no issue in following the instructions, especially when he heard that the greeting would earn him great respect from the priest. )

(x:: As they entered the room, his senses were nearly overwhelmed by the strong scent of the untamed wilds within. He was stunned into silence as he looked around, confronted by trees and other vegetation lining every surface of the room. In the middle stood a man who appeared to be trying his hardest to hide a mischievous grin. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] greeted [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] warmly before introducing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to the priest. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] took a deep breath before performing the 'greeting' to the best of his ability. To both of their surprises, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]'s smile became incredibly wide as he expressed his deepest gratitude for their effort in learning and performing the ancient Pixie greeting for him. Trying hard to suppress the surprise in his voice, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], claiming they should have never doubted him. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] apologised and promised to trust him more in the future.)

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] turned to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], expressing his joy that they had even brought breakfast, looking hungrily at [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] apologised, stating that it wasn't food but merely a companion on their journey. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] was disappointed but quickly recovered. They all engaged in friendly conversation until [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] asked if [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had ever been to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and if he would like to go. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] cautiously explained that it was a place he had never visited before but was interested in going to at some point. He couldn't say anything else before [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]'s mischievous smile returned. "Great!" he exclaimed as he placed his hand on [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s shoulder before teleporting to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. )

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suddenly found himself alone in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. He was surrounded by giant mushrooms that resembled trees more than the food he prepared for dinner whenever Chenris misbehaved. The ground was made of thick marsh that seemed to stretch on forever, and after a few confused, aimless steps, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] became stuck in the mud, slowly sinking down into a cold death. He struggled for what felt like hours as the mud consumed him [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]]. First, it took his legs, then his hands, his chest, and his arms, until he was left with nothing but a head on the ground, much like one finds when scavenging a battlefield for scraps and coin. Yet this head screamed for help that would never come. Soon, these screams ceased as the mud took his mouth, filling it with the vile taste of rot and disease. The mud was cold and unfeeling as it robbed the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] of his sense of smell next. When the mud slowly began to fill his ear canals, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had nearly given up and accepted his fate. He was tired, tired of fighting, and just wanted to relax and live a peaceful life with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. As a burning sensation replaced the air in his lungs, his world went dark as he sank through a void that did not care about his plight.)

(x:: Suddenly, he could breathe, and all his senses rushed back to him as he awoke in a different forest. He spotted something moving in the corner of his mind. In a dazed state, he chased after it, hoping to see a friendly face, but found only an Owlbear cub on the ground motionless. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to see what was wrong, but when he examined the face of the creature, it shifted grotesquely into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]'s, who shouted "BOO!!" in [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s face. Before he could do anything or even get over the initial shock. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] became stern as he warned, "Mama is here, and she looks angry." [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] slowly turned their neck and looked out in horror as a large owlbear howled and charged him down. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] instinctively went to grab the weapon that was no longer there. The last thing he saw was a claw scratch at his eyes. )

He awoke again, now acutely aware of the dryness in his throat, as though he had been wandering through [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] he currently found himself in for years. Conveniently, an oasis lay right in front of him, complete with all the shade and water he could ever desire. He continued his endless march towards his destination, which became clearer with each step. The temple of the oasis came into view, its emblem of a golden deer becoming his one true goal in life. Suddenly, he tripped and tumbled down a dune, rolling like a bug washed away by the rain. 

Rather than receiving a mouthful of sand, he ended up with a bruise on his back as he fell onto the floor of an exquisite house. The house was remarkable, with wooden floors and walls. Paintings that were so lifelike it felt as though magic had captured moments in time adorned the walls. The lights emitted no heat, their flames, like the walls, posed a dangerous invitation. The furniture was crafted from the finest materials, and the table was laden with food that looked too sumptuous for even a lord. The steak was seasoned to perfection, and he could even detect the presence of pepper, a spice that only the wealthiest kings could afford. By far, the strangest aspect of his palace was that one of the walls did not exist. Instead, it was open, revealing a face in the dark. In front of it stood a large rectangular black box supported by three iron legs, manoeuvred by [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|humans]] dressed in fine black clothing.

Suddenly, a sign illuminated characters in deep red, causing the garden of faces to erupt with laughter. It was there that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] spotted a beautiful woman with brown hair who appeared concerned for him. "Oh, Caleb, you're such a ditz." The red sign appeared once more, and the people laughed again. The two babies beside her cooed as he stammered in a voice he did not recognise, "M- m- m- my name isn't Cayleb. It's [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].",

Suddenly, one of the [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|humans]] in black shouted, "CUT!!" and the atmosphere immediately relaxed as all the black rectangular puppets stood up and began fiddling with the long black snakes connected to the boxes. The woman's expression shattered as people swarmed her with fine brushes and powders—similar to those [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] would use in the morning. He was about to speak when the women looked at him with disgust and snarled that he had to learn his lines or they would sack him. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was at a loss for words as more [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|humans]] in black directed him out of the room and outside. The ground was black and solid, and the forests had been replaced with large grey boxes. Different boxes moved along the black floor much like carriages would nobly proceed to their destination. However, this one moved with what he could only understand to be magic.

He was led by one of the [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|humans]], a woman, on one of the boxes and taken to an even larger grey box. She opened the carriage door and ushered him inside. Entering behind him, she locked the door, laughing manically as she drew a knife of exquisite craftsmanship. She began to ramble about how they were finally alone and that she, Lauren, could finally be his girlfriend. When he explained that he already had one, her laugh halted as she raised the knife up. She screamed, "IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, THEN NO CAN!!"

Instinctively, he went for the great axe that wasn't on his back, giving her time to dig the knife into his shoulder he screamed in pain before grabbing something heavy-looking and bringing it down on her head. the woman crumpled to the ground as blood pooled around her body. The next few months were a blur until they sat him down on a chair. The guards strapped him to the old chair and put a headband around his head. There were small snakes attached to the headband that all led to the panels with three levers on them. He bangs to scream, "I'm telling you, it was self-defence; she was going to kill me. Please don't do this!!" Words he did not fully understand. Nor did he know why he pled for his life when all he did was sit on a chair. All of the levers were pulled, and his head was full of searing pain, much as if [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s lightning bow had shot him. 

(x:: He woke up in a luscious green field with a golden temple in front of him. It was here that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] could no longer take it as his mind snapped into two. He died so many times only to wake to know a horrible death, and his will was only so strong. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] sat at the temple steps, laughing hysterically at the result of his work: the once proud [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] lay on the floor laugh and screaming like a child.)

(x:: Kerrigan, who had been inside sipping tea, heard [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s anguished scream and came to see what was wrong. When greeted with the sight outside, he chuckled slightly and exclaimed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] may have had a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] too much and told the priest to return to his duties. Complaining like a child asked to do their homework, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] returned to the [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] realm. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] approached [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], who refused to believe the world was real. After some time, he finally convinced the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] that he was real, and they finally calmed down. Once calmed and drinking some tea, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] simply stood up and said, "My turn!" before pushing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] over, a feat easily done with his mind in shambles.)

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began to fall through a dark void, falling past manifestations of all his memories. Eventually, he landed on the hard, rocky ground. The landing was painless, but the air was hot and humid. Before he could explore his new surroundings, a huge plumb of magma erupted from the ground, rocketing high into the sky. Using the magma as a gate, the figures exited with a malicious stare in their eyes. He didn't recognise them at first until slowly he saw the faces he had faced in battles. The people he had killed in war he did not the cause of. Soon, more recent victims emerged as they stood frozen with fear. Soon, his worst fears were realised as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] emerged from the magma, a great axe drawn and poised for revenge. Suddenly, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] appeared at his side "It seems that no one is free of their past, are they?". [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] didn't, couldn't, respond. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] gently led him through a portal into a part of the forest that was more ethereal than the rest. )

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] slowly calmed down, walking through a place that was truly beautiful beyond words. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] had led him in silence for a few minutes before finally explaining that this specific part of the glad was considered holy and was he first encountered [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had no words. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] continued walking forward, detailing how he came to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] and what he had given up to return to the world of the living. He apologises for taking things too far with him, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] and he were so excited about showing him their homelands that they forgot that a lot of their 'harmless' pranks weren't too harmless to others. He asked if [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wanted to return, and the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] nodded weakly. )

(x:: A magenta mist began to envelop them as they were transported back to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s room of worship. As they landed back in the room, a golden circle appeared below them, and they fell into another room.)

#### [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s Room
(x:: Anxious for answers, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stormed into [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s worship room, practically pulling [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] by the scruff of their neck. Seeing the same orb as before, their voice came out more like a demand than the question they had intended. They requested to know more about what was happening with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and whether it was possible to dispose of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]. The orb considered for a moment before revealing that they were more than happy to share this information, but it would come at a cost. The orb was willing to trade the information [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sought in exchange for their knowledge that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] was the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The orb clarified that this would affect the entire party. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was uncertain if this was a deal they could make on behalf of the whole group and asked if they could wait for the others to return and consult them for their opinions. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] also felt concerned that if they forgot about this, they might not take her back to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].)

They turned to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], whom they still held onto, and inquired what they thought of the deal. Was it too much to ask? [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], half-joking, questioned whether they even had an opinion since [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had been speaking for them the entire time. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly released them but remained determined to discover what was happening to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Almost shouting with panic and frustration, they exclaimed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] made no sense whatsoever. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] possessed some of Chenris’ memories, thoughts, and mannerisms but did not understand how they knew them all. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] concluded their rant by yelling, “Sometimes you’re so clever, and sometimes you’re so foolish, and I don’t understand how both can be true!!” 

(x:: ([[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave them a kind smile before responding, “Well, perhaps you would understand if you actually took the time to know me and… you know, talk to me?” [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was struck into silence as they realised how little they had cared to learn about the individual causing them so much distress. The orb broke the silence by saying they were happy to wait; in fact, they could teleport [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] into the room as soon as they were available. The orb then appeared very confused, looking flustered for the first time as it revealed that it was unsure of where the two were. The orb explained that it had knowledge of all the things that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] knew, yet had no idea where they were, which would have been impossible unless they were in a place beyond [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s control. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they go to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]’s room, but the orb revealed that this was still a location it could see. It might make sense if the two were taken to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. However, that was such a peculiar idea that the orb immediately dismissed it.  ))

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] decided to pass the time by praying at [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s altar, kneeling down and closing their eyes in quiet contemplation. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] would have found the scene quite peaceful if they hadn’t been so concerned by the sight of someone praying on [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]. The orb revealed a way to pass the time that benefitted both of them. The orb explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s library needed ‘processing power’ since there was so much information flowing in and out of the ed [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] decided to pass the time by praying at [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s altar, kneeling down and closing their eyes in quiet contemplation. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] would have found the scene quite peaceful if they hadn’t been so concerned by the sight of someone praying to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]. The orb revealed a way to pass the time that benefitted both of them. It explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s library needed ‘processing power’ as there was so much information flowing in and out of the domain. If [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] plugged into their hive mind and thought for them, then the orb would unplug him and teleport their friends into the room as soon as it was able. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] seemed less than thrilled and explained that they weren’t very good at thinking, so they probably wouldn't be of much use. The orb assured them that they wouldn’t be conscious during their processing and that they would mainly use their brain power. From their perspective, they would go to sleep and wake up to see [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] in the room with them.)

With little else to do, they agreed. For a split second, the golden glowing orb seemed to smile even though it was featureless, but before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could say anything, a golden tendril rushed down from the ceiling, jammed into the back of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s neck, and lifted them into the air. Their bodies began to convulse for a moment before falling limp, and their eyes glowed a faint golden white. Satisfied with the process being completed, the orb began to float over to the altar. The silence of the room was broken when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stood up from their prayers and turned with cold precision to face the orb. Their kind eyes turned to that of a doctor looking at a patient whose fate was already sealed as they spoke in the low and grave voice of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they were alone, and the orb replied in the affirmative. 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if the orb was aware of their situation; each word was said with a heavy level of disgust and anger. The orb said it did in its most nonchalant way. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] sighed and reasoned that there was probably no way to escape this fate, to which the orb gleefully confirmed this to be true. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s next question was if the orb was going to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] everything when the others arrived. the orb confirmed this to be true but said they could be convinced to leave out the details. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] let out a more profound sigh and asked if this came in the form of a deal. The orb explained that they would gladly not give any deals to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] if [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave up the memories of their parents, reasoning that details of a person should be bargained with details of other people. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] refused the deal and every counteroffer the orb made. The orb floated in the air, confused about why all their offers were rejected, especially as how easily [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] used to make deals before. They explained that, unlike him, ⚔️ [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] still had their innocent intact, and he would be damned if he would be the reason for another's pain and loss of innocents. 

The orb thinks for a moment before relenting and explaining that it will give them this deal for free, shocking [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Confused, they asked how this would affect their deal with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], and they promised to explain everything happening to them. The orb explained that they would disconnect from the hive mind temporarily, meaning they wouldn't know anything about ⚔️ [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] anymore. This way, they would still technically be explaining everything they knew about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Satisfied with this, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] agreed to the deal and returned to their prayers. 

(x:: Soon, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] landed on the floor just as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was put down and disconnected from the hive mind. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] feels sick, but otherwise, the experience was just as the orb had explained it to them, they had no memories of what they had 'processed'. They got up and began to explain the situation to the others who were hesitant to take the deal, and when they put it to the vote, everyone but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] voted no. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to console [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], explaining that there would be plenty of other chances to learn more about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] - ones that wouldn't cause them all to forget important information. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is disappointed but eventually understands where they are all coming from and mentally decides to do their best to at least get to know [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a little before jumping to such rash decisions. The orb made a sound like it was clearing its throat and said they had a side of the bargain to fulfil and explained that, to their knowledge, there was no way to reverse the possession of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]].)

(x:: With everything settled, the group had no reason to stay in the room and bid their farewells to the orb. As they were leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] spell on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and ⚔️ [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]'s voices they said, "Glad to see you're not a hypocrite" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] momentarily stopped in their tracks as the rest walked past him out of the room. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was the last to leave, shooting them a quick glance before leaving as well. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] soon joined them as they decided that it might be best if they went into 🏛️ [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' room next as none of them knew anything about the god, and it would be a great chance for them to learn some new information.)


#### [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' Room
(x:: After going through the door, they found themselves in a massive wheat field. In the middle, a man wearing a large hood was working the fields with an impossibly large scythe. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] approached the man, who sat on a large log as they talked. The man asked if they wanted or needed anything from him, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that they had come to learn about [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] and figured this would be the best place to do so. As the man spoke, he never looked up and revealed his face, instead opting to look at the floor as he spoke. He explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] was the god that ensured the world kept spinning and all things remained as they were. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tilted their head in confusion, saying that this sounded a lot like [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. The priest admitted that when put like that, they did sound quite similar, but there was one key difference: [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] held dominion over time, whereas [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] held dominion over everything. He ensured that the world kept spinning, people kept being born, and everyone kept dying. [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] ensured that the natural order of the world was maintained. )

(x:: Most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] remained confused, so the priest explained that when [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] chose to manifest, he would often do so as a juggler spinning many plates. Each of these plates could be seen as a natural part of life: Life, death, decay, growth, prosperity and famine. Each of these plates is necessary for the universe to function properly, and it was [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' job to ensure each of these plates kept spinning. If they ever stopped, he made sure they began to spin again.)

(x:: The priest went on to explain that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] used to look after the dreaming world as well, but he struggled to keep track because the rules were different. He still had to maintain balance over the waking parts of the universe. After a few instances of things going wrong, the god decided it would be best to create someone who would watch over the sleeping world while he focused on the waking world. This caused him to give birth to his daughter, whom he named [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]].)

(x:: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asks that if [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] has the power over life and death, then could he thematically kill a God? The priest explained that although [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] controlled the force of life and death, the gods were above such concepts and transcended the natural order, causing them to be outside of [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' powers. He explained that most gods also lived in their own domains and, as such, could not be influenced by other gods. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked that if they were to come to the mortal realm, then could [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] kill them. The priest explained that when the gods manifest on the world, they do so by pushing their essence through a pinhole, and the manifestation wasn't truly them, just an aspect of them. Killing this aspect would not affect the actual god[^1]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] had any known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s, to which the priest explained that he didn't. With all their questions answered, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] thanked the man for his time and answered and left the room and returned to tending the fields. )

#### [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s Room
(x:: Outside, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took a deep breath as they mentally prepared to enter [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' room. Questioning out loud if this was really the correct thing to do. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suggested that I couldn't hurt to ask, worst case, they could all step in to help if it came to that. Slightly reassured, they all entered the room. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] was sitting near the altar reading as they all entered. He greeted them warmly, asking if there was anything he could do to help. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dodged around the subject as they asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] knew of someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he knew of her when they both fought in the war and explained that she was a great general who gave her life to destroy an entire army Battalion. He explained that in some circles, she is regarded as almost a sudo [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]. )

(x:: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] comes clean and explains that they actually found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], and she currently has processed his brain. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] looks terrified and asks to know the full story and becomes increasingly terrified when they explain how they found [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] and then [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], now on the verge of panic, begged to know that the sword was safe and hidden away still. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] deliver the troubling news that the sword was stolen by someone they suspect to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] broke out in a cold sweat and told them to follow him as he walked incredibly quickly for an old man. He took them out into the main library and into the back areas through a door labelled 'Authorised staff only'. Down a few corridors, they walked through a heavily guarded gate and down a steep flight of stairs. until they entered a large and dark room - illuminated only by a pristine white pillar. )

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that they shouldn't be down here, but he assumed they needed access to one of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] and a room where no one could hear them. He paused for a moment before continuing. He explained that they needed to kill him because it was the only way for them to justify their being down here after they were finished, and he didn't want to be around for what was to come. Seeing the pillar, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suggested talking to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] to get some much-needed answers. Getting comfortable, he went through the usual motions, and before long, they stood before [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], who greeted them warmly:)


> [!quote] 
"Ah, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], a beacon of light,
Returned to my presence, a joyous sight.
It has been long, though time’s veil is thin,
Since last your voice danced upon the wind.
Your name is a melody, etched in my core,
A bond unbroken, forevermore.
Come, speak to me, share your tale,
For in your words, life’s truths prevail."

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] confessed that [[Uti †\|Uti †]] had been killed and updated the being on everything that had happened since they last spoke. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]'s response:)

> [!quote] 
Oh, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]], a flame now quenched by fate,
His journey ended, beyond the mortal gate.
Grief weighs heavy, a sorrow untold,
For his light was a treasure, a warmth to behold.
>
And now, a shadow clings to your kin,
A darkness wrestles for control within.
The gods grow restless, their whispers near,
Their presence stirs in the air, I fear.
>
Yet even in these times of pain,
You thought of me, in chains and disdain.
To free my spirit, to hear my plea,
You stood united, a beacon to me.
>
For this, I thank you, with all my core,
Your courage and kindness I’ll cherish evermore.
Though trials loom and storms may rise,
Your strength shall endure beneath the skies.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if there was any way to kill a god, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]'s response:

> [!quote] 
> To slay a god is a riddle untold,
A task not written in legends of old.
Their essence vast, their threads entwined,
With realms beyond the mortal mind.
>
No blade nor spell can claim their breath,
For gods are bound to more than death.
Yet whispers speak of sacrifice rare,
A power to rival, if one would dare.
>
But truth eludes me, I cannot say,
How such divinity might decay.
Beware the path such questions lead,
For gods do watch the hearts that bleed.
>
To kill a god is to sever the thread,
But what follows then, when balance is dead?
Their roots run deep, their essence vast,
A death for a god may never last.
>
Yet to force them out, to break their claim,
To banish their power, unbind their name—
This may unshackle the world’s design,
Restoring the balance where mortals shine.
>
For exile spares what wrath would wake,
A vengeance divine the world cannot take.
So tread with care, let wisdom lead,
For forcing them out may be the deed.
Akin, the steadfast, a titan of will,
Whose heart burned bright, unyielding, still.
He bore the weight of the heavens wide,
To cast the god to the void outside.
>
With arms that trembled, yet did not break,
He held firm the skies for the world's sake.
A sacrifice vast, a life consumed,
In the echoes of time, his name is entombed.
>
The firmament shifted beneath his might,
A god expelled into endless night.
Yet such a price no mortal should pay,
Lest we find ourselves lost the same way.
>
Remember his strength, his burden untold,
A story of valor, in whispers of gold.

(Original question missing), [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]'s response:
> [!quote] 
Love, the force that none can confine,
A power eternal, a spark divine.
Stronger than steel, than magic or flame,
It weaves through the world, unbound by name.
>
And you, dear souls, are cherished so,
By hearts unseen, more than you know.
Through trials faced and battles won,
The love you’ve kindled shines like the sun.
>
Hold it close, this sacred fire,
It lifts the weary, takes hearts higher.
For in love’s light, all shadows fall,
And it proves to be the mightiest power of all.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] thanked the god for his wisdom and help and said goodbye for now and promised to help him as soon as they could. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] said goodbye:

> [!quote] 
Farewell for now, but not goodbye,
Our paths will cross beneath the sky.
Though I must part, the bond remains,
A thread of gold through time's vast chains.
>
Walk with courage, steadfast and true,
The world has much yet in store for you.
And when the stars align once more,
We’ll meet again, as we did before.



# Trivia & Notes
[^1]: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] likes to think of this as how the main villain, Darkside, exists. Every time he appears, it is just an aspect of the being, as if the real Darkside entered the world; the weight of his existence would destroy reality.
