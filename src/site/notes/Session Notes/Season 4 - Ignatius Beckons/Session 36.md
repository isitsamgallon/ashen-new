# Session Summary 
After the intense battle, Mordecai was faced with a decision—what to do with the father who had caused him such trauma. Torn between revenge and mercy, he ultimately chose to spare him, believing in the potential for change. Supported by Drache and Korrigan, Mordecai grappled with his identity, morality, and the weight of his past. The moment ended in a heartfelt group hug, including a reluctant but welcomed Halfbie, providing a rare breath of emotional clarity.

Their journey took them toward the Great Wall after briefly tending to Mordecai's recovering father. The party walked in a subdued mood, reflecting on their recent battles and revelations. During the night, prophetic dreams plagued most of them, hinting at hidden fates and people from their past—visions linked to Somnora, the god of dreams. Korrigan sent magical animal messages to allies, hoping for guidance, while Halfbie began to piece together troubling divine influences through cryptic visions.

Tracking a dream-related vision of Emmeline, the group chased a magical rat to Nakatoro, finding evidence of a fight involving Emmeline and another mysterious Ronin. Their leads eventually brought them to a cryptic meeting with Xekai, who confirmed Emmeline’s safety but offered few answers. Halfbie, through a secret deal with Aeloria, discovered she was taken to Eldros. Though grateful for her safety, Drache’s worry deepened, especially with the implication of divine interference and the threat of Somnora’s manipulation growing ever closer.

Finally, the party reached the Wall—a towering, ancient barrier watched by silent, silver-armoured guards. What seemed like a defensive marvel was quickly revealed to be a prison of sorts, with magically bound warriors still guarding centuries after the Wall’s creation. Halfbie and Mordecai grew uneasy with the unsettling aura around the soldiers and the lack of clear governance. The Wall, it seemed, was more than just a barrier—it was a remnant of old wars and forgotten powers, and crossing it would take them deeper into danger and mystery.

# Full Session Notes
[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood over their father, unsure of what to do now he had beaten the man who had caused him so much grief and pain. The decision paralysed him as, on the one hand, he was a good man, and on the other hand, he was a terrible person and father. Seeing the indecision in their eyes, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] put a reassuring hand on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s shoulder. With a slight smile, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] said aloud, "I don't know what he deserves... If we leave him, death feels inevitable at this point". [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] agreed but wondered if he had the chance to become a better man now he had been shown the truth, "Or do you think that's beyond him?" he muttered more to himself than anything. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] held back so much anger, hatred, tears, and grief for a childhood lost. He explained how he felt this whole mess was stupid, but most strange of all, it felt like, for the first time, their father was proud of them. "But I don't know if that was because I was being the monster that he raised me to be."

The room was silent, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wrestled with a whirlwind of emotions inside of themselves. Finally, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] spoke up, explaining how he didn't think they could live with the idea of being the course of both of his parent's deaths. "it's not use asking him either; he'll say he wants to do die... let him live..." the statement started strong and filled with conviction be tailing off at the end. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s hand tightened on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s shoulder as his face morphed into an approving smile [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't see. 

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] silently motioned his magic into a healing spirit that washed over [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] with a newfound sense of peace. With a quick gesture, the spirit moved over to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's father, healing him slightly. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] lamented that even with this matter resolved, neither he nor his mother could ever return home. There was simply too much pain and distrust for him to do so. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's hand now rested on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's other shoulder, "You know, [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] may not be your home anymore, but that's okay because home is just a place where you are comfortable. Once upon a time, my home was probably [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and now it's some temple in a mysterious forest.)

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't stop a single tear from running down their cheeks. They quickly regained composure so as not to ruin their makeup. "He can be good. If I can do it, so can he. And he'll have to live with that for the rest of his life."

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the two for reassurance, "This doesn't make me a bad person, does it?" [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s expression softened as [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s smile refused to falter. "[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]], sparing a life doesn't make you a bad person. You have lived an extraordinary life even after being exiled. Give him a chance to reflect and repair what he's done to you and everyone else he has wronged." [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood stock still, unable to fully accept what he heard. "if it eases your conscience to keep him alive, you've earned some respite from this. You don't deserve to have the weight of losing both your parents on your shoulders." 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], unsure what else to do, hugged the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] returned the hug in kind, his arms acting as a huge weighted blanket. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] jumped onto the hug with his arms and legs wrapped around them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't help but laugh as he joked that it was 'Totum Of The Bear Hug.' [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] snapped back to reality, looking back from the window reflection upon hearing the other's laughter. Before they could react, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] threw his Thorn Whip spell at them and used it like a lasso to force them into a hug. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to protest, unsure if there was a real place in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] to join in with such things, but soon gave up when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] invited them in. 

The bearhug soon ended, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] knelt next to his father; the man was still unconscious even after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used some of their magic to heal him. Kerrigan wondered if they knew enough to help, considering the man had been bisected in the battle. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stepped forward, saying they wouldn't be able to heal something so serious, but they could at least stem the bleeding and help him wake up. After a few incantations, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father awoke in excruciating pain.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father looked up at him and, with a tear escaping his eyes, exclaimed, "You fought like a warrior, that's all I ever wanted. However you disrespect me as a warrior who was a duel to the death, Now who isn't playing by the rules..."

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] joyfully questioned if they ever played by the rules, especially when they thought they were wrong. He slowly lifted his hand to grab [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s hand before saying, "Thank you, my son," a rare smile infecting his face. 

"I... will never be a Thornwood," [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] replied, conviction etched into each word. 

"No, but you are a Reverence. She was equally as much me as I was her. Someday, he will come to know this is true and that we loved each other."

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] painedly looked at him as they realised he couldn't return home. The father agreed, saying that ever since that night, even if he did rebuild the physical house, it would never truly feel like home. He reasoned that he was much like [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] now, away from home, sitting up a campsite, travelling from here to there, maybe staying in a city occasionally. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s eyes flared with anger as they cut him off, stating that the only difference was that they were 12 when they were cast out of their family and hunted down like animals. 

The father half-jokingly retorted that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had more legs than him, referring to the wooden leg he received from his bounty hunter days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] returned the retort with a cold. "You seemed to manage fine. 

In the background, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] opened a notepad to quickly write down and ask [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] about their extra legs, which is not common to Tieflings. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father continued with a proud smile, exclaiming that once recovered, they would meet again to have a proper duel. "it would be a duel of friends, a duel of mutual allies, a duel of respect... Maybe not a duel to the death, especially with that fucked up demon in your head.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] let out a worried smile before confirming how messed up that was. The father exclaimed that he would've branded them a Duelbreaker, but he wasn't sure if that would work on them as they possessed someone else. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s hand instinctively went toothier forehead at the mention of the branding. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wondered if the brand would appear on their head, ruining their makeup. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] exclaimed that this had been oddly cathartic despite the pain and distress. The father agreed, saying, "It is. to fight... be primal.. to beat the man who goaded you your whole life. Why do you think we all do it, Maud? There's a whole world out there, bandits and assholes. And all we want is a little [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] of catharsis."

"but we're better than that", [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] replied simply. 

"Or are we all just animals?" reason [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father.

"We could have killed you. All of us, together now," said [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], matter of factly. 

"Maybe you are better; maybe most of us are animals, but there are few good ones left", [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father wondered. 

"You will learn. The one thing I ask of you while you wander about the lands: Learn to be better. As you know, I started as a monster but became better. You should do the same." [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s voice was tense as each word sprinted from his mouth faster than he could think. 

"I'm an old dog, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], but I'll try my best," he replied, conviction in his voice."

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nodded with satisfaction before standing up and telling the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] that they were leaving. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] with a confused look on their face, exclaiming that they didn't know [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s dad was a druid. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was also confused, saying the father looked much like a [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]], not an old dog. They both shut up when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] shot them a look. 

Looking at the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]], Kerrigan asked [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] if they could create a new leg for the man, like the one they fashioned for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], pointing at the flowerbed foot they made for the barbarian. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said they were good and asked the man if he had a favourite flower. The father sternly told them to back off and not dishonour him; he would leave and shoo them off later. 

(x::Once they had gathered their things, they moved on. Heading outside, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] realised they were only about an hour's walk from [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]]. The road was straightforward from then on, reaching [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]], the next stop on the Tour Du Ashen. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] reminded them that afterwards, they should stop in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] to investigate those dissaprences. They walked silently, with none quite knowing what to say. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] eventually broke the silence by asking if everyone was okay, as they were chained upside down in that dungeon. Everyone reported being okay, as many had experienced worse on their adventures. Kerrigan had slight burns where the iron touched their skin, but he was also fine. )

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pulled out their notebook and mentioned that they did have one question from the whole ordeal. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took a deep breath before saying to go ahead. In a sombre tone, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] asked about [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s third leg, to which the whole party burst out into laughter, with [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] standing confused in the middle. It soon became apparent that [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had not understood the joke leading to them awkwardly explaining that a third leg is often a euphemism for a penis. This only caused [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] to become even more confused, as a leg and a penis are two very different things. After 15 minutes of arguing back and forth, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] finally understood the joke. They flipped to the page in their notebook titled "slang", where they wrote everything down.

(x::They walked with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], exclaiming that it felt weird to be so lovely. The rest would have none of it as they all congratulated [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] on doing the right thing, even when it was tough. Unable to take the compliments, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly switched the topics to the Seifer taking control of their body. It may have been cool to watch, but not being in control of their own body was terrifying. Seifer tried to downplay the experience and explained that she only did what she was told and didn't even kill the man. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hesitantly thanked them for this. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pointed out that they did find out that there wasn't much they could do about the possession when they were in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|the All-Father Temple]]. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wondered how much of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] 's powers could be used through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's body. Seifer explained that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's body was too weak to use her full powers, but as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] got more powerful, she could use more. )

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] joked that they hit the gym more often before Seifer cold explained that physical strength meant nothing to them and their powers. Although they could use losing a little bit of weight. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] didn't repeat that last bit to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], instead asking if they all thought their tunic made their butt look big. Seifer coldly said yes, while [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] said it looked big, but in a good way, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] agreed. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] got closer as they inspected [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] before simply stating that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s face was somewhat symmetrical, cautioning [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to punch the elf. 

In [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's head, Seifer said, "You should consider black. Black and red always goes well together. It would also hide your... You look great, darling. It's fine. Just black" 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] retorted that they liked purple but that maybe a black tunic with purple detailing would look amazing. Seifer thought that would be much, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] didn't care. 

"Yeah, my name's Safer, and I know all about fashion." [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] said mockingly.

"I know a lot about many things, " Seifer replied, annoyed. 

"Fashion is Cyclical ", [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] remarked as they pulled out some scraps of appearance with complex calculations. "By my calculations, bell-bottom breeches should be back in fashion soon. So you could get on that ahead of the trend by wearing them now."

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] said they would rather die and completely ignored [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] when they pointed out that this was what the maths said. 

(X:: Passing [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]], they noticed goblins guarding the gates, dressed up like samurai gear. They watched intently at [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] as they walked past but did nothing about them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave them a happy wave, to which a younger-looking [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] waved back before quickly returning to their duties. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly turned to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], saying that was an extra point for them. )

Carrying down the path, it was slowly getting dark, and they decided to set up camp just off the side of the road. While [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to cast Leomund's Tiny Hut, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] exclaimed that they needed a long rest after the day they had just had. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] agreed, stating they only needed some rest built and deserved it. Soon, the spell was up, and they all got comfortable. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly fell asleep while reading a fantasy book called 'Two Pieces'. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quietly closed the book with a bookmark and tucked them in properly before turning to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. 

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sat beside [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], resting against a tree, before saying softly, "I'm proud of you. You're becoming a better man. I know you give yourself such a hard time, and you think you're terrible, but what I saw today... that's growing."

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is very clearly touched by [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s kind words, saying they learnt from the best. "I look at how we've all changed. I am a storyteller. That is my trade. When I wasn't at the club, I... I created stories. I put on little shows. I told the adventures of heroes and villains who were mostly made up. I have seen how power has corrupted. How the thirst for knowledge consumes the ones we love. How our questing and trying to do the right thing sometimes leaves us broken. And yet, we still keep pushing forward. We are so different from when we started, like I think the first thing I did was insult you!"

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s face cracked into a smile, "We really have come a long way, haven't we?!"

"I just... I worry. I worry a lot." replied [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]

"I think we're all worried." said [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] matter-of-factly

"I especially worry about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]." Looking at the boy sleeping peacefully, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] said, "I don't know if this is an Uvam thing, um... When you let sweet tea brew for ages, it eventually turns bitter."

"Just like a lot of us have learnt lessons for the better, sometimes people learn lessons for the worse." [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] mused. 

"And what if that's our fault? What if we're the reason they turn bitter?!" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] exclaimed 

"Most we can do is try to set the best example, teach them, and help them, but there's only so much we can do." [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] said. 

They soon all fell asleep. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] walked around the dreaming world, unsure what to expect, as Elvin often did not dream. Jessamine appeared in front of them. She looked like she had a few greying hairs. 
As she turned to face them, she simply said, 'Find me.' before the dream dispatched into an uncomfortable silence. 

(X:: Drache dreamt of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. However, she wore a black farmer's hat covering most of her face. She was carrying a sword, and he watched as she began fighting what looked like three or four [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit cutters]] in the centre of a town. She quickly found herself outnumbered and left battered and bruised, bleeding out. Before he could do anything, the dream dissipated. )

(X:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's dream showed him his old friend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]]. She was looking at a wolf that seemed to be eating someone. She raised her hand up and simply asked [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] to find her. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] awoke from his dream in a startle. It was early morning, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's barrier was still intact. He sat up, leaning against his pack, just thinking about that dream, unsure of what his dream truly meant. Soon, the morning came, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] jumped into action by casting Animal Messenger twice. He caught a rabbit and sent it to the vampires, saying, "Hello, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Cosmo\|Cosmo]] and siblings. Uh, here is another rabbit for you to enjoy. I hope you're well. This is your friend, The [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], coming to you live from near the Wall uh.... Bye.")

(X:: The other was sent to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]], saying, "Hey, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]]. Long time no see..... I am travelling through [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Nakatoro\|Nakatoro]] and am going to be heading down past the Wall and back up the Dawn. Please come and say hi and let me know what you're doing." )

(X:: He then lets the squirrel go and waits to see its direction. The squirrel begins running towards the mountain, presumably to find a path around it. However, the rabbit hops in circles before heading to a nearby tree. As soon as the rabbit reaches the tree, four puffs of smoke can be seen coming from a nearby bush. )

(X:: Soon, everyone woke up. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] immediately got out a small blue journal with glitter on it titled "Dream Journal," and they began writing in detail about what they saw. Once they were done, they closed the book and asked if anyone had had a weird dream last night or if it was just them. Everyone but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had strange dreams, and they explained what they saw individually. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had a slight twinge of jealousy as they felt left out of their weird dreams.)

(X:: After hearing about [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 's dream, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] exclaimed they had to go help her. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is unable to remember where she would be. Kerrigan worriedly asked if the dreams felt similar to those made by the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]], and he says they felt slightly similar but not as bad. )

(X:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's, now sitting cross-legged and deep in thought before rushing to check their notes. The rest watched in anticipation until [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] revealed that [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] is known for messing with people with prophetic dreams. She would often create dreams of events that will happen in the future or may have already occurred in the past, but usually, they can't control. )

(X:: With all this talk of Gods, the group became concerned, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] used his Detect Evil and Good ability to check what was around them. The ability revealed Fey, Celestial, Undead and Dragons in the detection area (about 12 miles). )

(X:: With each passing moment, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 's anxiety becomes more and more evident. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to calm him down but to no avail, saying that she was probably fine and would be, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] exclaimed that if there was even a hint of danger, he would save her as he refused to lose her again. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that it would take a while to travel to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], and they didn't even know if that was where she was. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] exclaimed that he knew a fast way and told [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] to jump on his back, and Wild Shaped into a horse.)

(X:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jumped on, and they raced toward [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]]. They made the journey in an hour and a half. However, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was exhausted from the endless sprinting in his horse. They frantically searched the town but could not find Emeline anywhere. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] becomes highly frustrated and asks [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] to use his spell to track Emeline down. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] casts the animal messenger spell again on a rat, only to find it heading back in the direction they just came. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] runs after the rat with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] on his back. )

(X:: Later, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] spot a magically infused rat running past them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sarcastically asks if they should chase after the rat, which seems essential. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says why not and starts chasing the rat. When [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] shouts to follow the rat from across the field, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is about to protest. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] makes a chase and manages to catch the rat. They explain that if they keep the rat, they can use it like a compass, so no one has to keep running like an idiot. )

(X:: The rat soon led them to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Nakatoro\|Nakatoro]]. The square looked familiar to the one [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] saw in his dream. However, the streets were deserted, and it was eerily quiet. In the middle of the square was a large puddle of blood sounded by wrecked and abandoned market stalls. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] walked up to the block and quickly cast a spell on it. While they did this, the rest searched around and found a bits of metal shaving and some loose bits of straw from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] 's hat. )

(X:: Once [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's spell was done, they stood up and informed them that this was, in fact, blood, but more interestingly, it was a mixture of five different people's blood as well as some machine oil like the stuff [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] used. They next decided to ask around and see if any locals knew anything. They eventually found an old man in a nearby house who explained that a bunch of [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]] were harassing people and trying to steal money from the people in the market when suddenly two Ronin Jumped to stop them. Both wore heavy clocks and hats so none could see who they were. )

(X:: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pointed out to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] that they said The [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit Cutters]] weren't good. The old man interjected, saying that not all of them are bad; some towns have really good people, but others, like the ones in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]], weren't the nicest. When asked, the old man had no idea where they were; they seemed to disappear just as fast as they appeared. Allegedly, their husband swore they vanished in a flash of purple. They thanked the man for his help; he told them to ensure the two were okay, as it looked like they had been beaten badly in the fight. )

(X:: Once out of earshot, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] exclaimed the flash of purple had to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sat down, confused as to why she would be working with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]; he understood her standing up to people but not with [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|the Auditors]]. Before doing anything rash, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] suggested they write Emmaline's name in the book of Fortten Truths and see if the book's random fact would be useful. They agree, and the book simply informs them that she used to work at [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] salaciously says well done. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says they learned something new even though it wasn't helpful in their search. )

(X:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] summoned a new totem spirit; this time, it looked like a lynx and seemed to help sharpen their vision. With this enhanced sight, they could easily track down some magical residue that matched that of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] 's portals. They also quickly found a building that contained the bodies of 3 dead [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]]. However, just because her foes were dead doesn't mean she was okay, reasoned [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. )

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a seat and began to think; [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] half-sarcastically laughed at what the wise man was feeling and told him to be quiet. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] opened their eyes and said that because they couldn't figure out where the portal went, it must mean it took Emmaline somewhere not in their realm. They then began to examine the magical residue more and to try and learn which realm she went to. 

(X:: As they did so, a golden feeling began to gnaw at the back of their head. They instantly accepted, and when they opened their eyes, they found themselves in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] 's Library. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] stood before them, and Chenris stood beside her, although he refused to speak when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said hi. )

(X:: "oh, well, I guess it's time for our second deal, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Well, we've made one before, didn't we?" [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] said with a smirk.)

(X:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], a bit confused, said it wasn't really a deal and that they would always be happy to have a friend with them. They both ignored Chenris, who was obviously rolling his eyes. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] explained that that was the deal, but it didn't matter now. Halfbies looked at their hands before exclaiming, "I'm a businessman!!")

(X:: "Anyway, I will tell you exactly where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and who the other Ronin is. Exchange for... I've got to think now... In exchange for knowledge of the lands which you came from.")

(X:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] soon accepted the deal as it would mean they could have more adventures later. They took their hands on it, and when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] next opened their eyes, they were back in the real world. They stood up, exclaiming they knew where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] was. They explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] had been taken to [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] but did not explain where they got this knowledge. The rest, assuming [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] figured it out from the magic, accepted the explanation but wondered why [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] would have something to do with the Gods as an Auditor. )

(X:: With little else that could be done, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] shouted for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and instantly, a purple portal opened in front of them, closing before they could see inside. Standing there, he said, "You called?")

(X:: "Hey [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. How are you? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. We're worried about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]." said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]].)

(X:: "Oh hey, I'm good, thanks. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] is fine," said [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] matter-of-factly as [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sighed in relief. )

(X:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] reassured him she was fine and safe, although she was dizzy. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] inquired about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] 's whereabouts, while [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shared their lack of interest in journeying to Eldro's realm. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions having strange dreams involving old loved ones, prompting a question about Jessamine and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]], but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] admits to not knowing who they are. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] explained that this sounded like [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and cautioned that she often likes to play with people. )

(X:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then asked why he had saved Emmaline. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cut them off, explaining that that was the right question. The correct one is, 'Why did [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] need saving?' He answered his question, "Because she was very injured, and I have a responsibility." )

(X:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] refused to elaborate on this responsibility, saying it was a pact he had signed long ago. When [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], how can we help you?" He simply said they just need to continue doing what they've been doing already but to please pick up the pace. He then confirmed that going on their way to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was the correct way to go. They all promised to try to speed up what they were doing. )

"Yeah, we thought we would have a look at The Wall. Do you know the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour de Ashen]]? I assume you do." said Halbie 

(X:: "Yes, you're going down to the Wall, and then you're going to go up, and then you're probably going to see [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]]. And then you're going to go towards [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and then there will be a whole debacle." said [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] dismissively.)

"Why is there going to be a debacle there?" asked [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 

"Spoilers" replied [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]

"I need to kill someone apparently," said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], anxious to know why.

(X:: "Well, you're going to kill many people between now and then," said [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] matter-of-factly. As I said, it was merely a duty rather than a kindness. Emmaline is very busy and says she misses you, but she knows what she's doing is worth it.")

"Could you be able to let us know when Emmaline is up in our world?" asked [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]

(X:: "Oh, they'll be back plenty. I'm sure you'll meet with them. In fact, yes, you're scheduled to meet with them at some point soon," said [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], checking the back of his hand as she said, "Right, I'll go back to what I was doing, and you guys can continue on.")

(X:: He then quickly opens a portal and steps through it. Before the portal closed, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was able to get a good glimpse inside, seeing the lush fields of wheat associated with [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they all get some rest as it was getting into the evening now; [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tried to suggest they didn't know and should continue to the Wall but soon gave up when everyone pointed out how exhausted he was. They all go to the Adventures Guild and sleep the night away. )

(X:: During the night, all of them but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had strange dreams again. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dreamt of his young brother enlisting with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit cutters]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] Dreamt of Jessamine again; this time, she tended to her chickens, and beasts could be heard growling in the background. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] dreamt of the wolves eating the person again. However, this time, he noticed that the person was [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]]. )

They all awoke the next morning. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] awoke with a yelp and began rocking, worrying that the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] looked alarmingly like [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sat up, confused, as he had no dreams that night. They all explained their dreams and how they all seemed to have more details this time. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] assumed that because drachms appeared to happen the day off, they couldn't rule out the possibility of this event happening soon. He joked and suggested they wait to see how long it takes for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's brother to come to kill them. With a glare from [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], they all stopped their laughter and got ready for the day. 

(X:: Soon, they were on the road. Along the way, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked, " Say, Chenris. Are you looking forward to seeing the Wall?" When [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't reply, he said,  "I mean, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], are you looking forward to seeing the wall?" [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly exclaimed that they had heard so much about the Wall and wanted to see it for ages. Before asking if anyone knew what it was there for, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] exclaimed that the Wall separates [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] from the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was enamoured with the idea and was excited to see a wall that was so big and important, but found it weird that none of them had seen it before as it was so important. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] chalked it up to them getting distracted so easily. )

(x:: As they walked on, the maple forest dissipated, turning into a wide-open field. Carrying on, there were loads and loads of soldiers dressed in pure silvery metal, which shimmered in the light. Cresting a hill, they were confronted with the monolith, which was the Wall. Standing at over 50 tall and stretching past the horizon on either end. Every 100 meters was a guard tower with more guards standing watch in pairs. Getting closer, they felt over 20 eyes fall on them as the guards examined them from their posts. Due to the helmets, it was impossible to see their eyes, but from a brief glimpse, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] spotted the tell-tail signs of different [[Other Information/Races/Races\|races]] and saw at least 30 other species standing as guards. The Wall was made of the same stone as the nearby mountains. )

(x:: Carrying on, they walked alongside [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]], constantly feeling the many gazes watch them suspiciously. Came to a space in the Wall that had to make room for a huge castle gate guarded by 100s of guards. Off to the side, they saw a small door, which they assumed was an information office. Approaching, none of the guards reacted, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] knocked on the open door, and they were invited in. A guard inside extended an arm silently, gesturing them to the Clerk's desk. )

At the desk, the Clerk could be found writing some in a long and old scroll. He looked up briefly to ask if he could help them before returning to his scroll. 

"We just want to find out some information about the wall, about who fortifies this, and who keeps this running, " said [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] confidently.  

(x:: The Clerk simply stated that it was run by the Wall's clerks and guards. The Wall acted as its own entity and did not get involved with politics. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked why it was so important to keep the Wall functioning. The Clerk snorted before explaining, "Well, it stops other nations from invading the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]]. If the first Sundering happened again, it would hopefully delay that as well. We won't be able to stop it, but we can delay it for about 10 years." )

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked who the lead/ coordinator was for all of this. The Clerk explained that there was no lead and that the Wall acted as more of a collective than anything. The Clerk lamented that people used to volunteer for the watch, but that isn't so common when [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] asked if this was a paid job. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked how there were so many guards if they weren't being paid to be there, and the Clerk just said, "They're bound here."

"Magically?" questioned [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].

"Sure," said the Clerk coldly

"Are these the same guards or these people that have just kind of been taken in?" asked [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], their voice tight with concern. 

"These are the same guards that were here the day the wall was constructed, yes." said the Clerk cooly 

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then asked when the Wall had been constructed, and the Clerk explained it was built very soon after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]]. It's half-baked weird how the guards could've been around for so long if they weren't all [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]]. )

"Lets just say the armour helps with that issue." said the Clerk 

(x:: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked to the guards and, now that they were closer, felt an ominous presence coming from them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] examined closer and realised that the Armour didn't seem to have the wear's best interests in mind. )

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], unaware of this, asked if it was possible to cross into [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] from there. The Clerk confirmed it was possible but wasn't recommended, especially as they wouldn't be able to get back in this and would have to go through [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] or similar routes.)


# Trivia & Notes
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Jae Knight\|Jae Knight]] was not present for this session, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] was deep in thought.
