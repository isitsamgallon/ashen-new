# Full Session Notes
(x:: [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] stood in silence over the body of the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]]. The room was huge, with people and bodies strewn about the floor and hanging from the ceiling by their legs. The silence broke as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] cried out in pain from battle wounds. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to heal the man but had little magic to spare. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], still filled with magical vigour, stepped in and released a wave of healing energy over [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]. )

(x:: With [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] no longer in danger, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's curiosity improved, and they began to poke at the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|angel under the well]]'s body. A body that was slowly fading to magical dust. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] told them to leave it alone lest they encounter another [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] situation. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at them blankly [^1] before complaining that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] never loots the body, and a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] could have some beneficial items on their quest. Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could protest, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] said [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had a point. )

(x:: With a cheeky smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaimed that they would do what [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] said, as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s suggestions are always so dull and get in the way. Before quickly returning to their snooping. Their efforts were rewarded when they found a small vial of black smoke topped with a large cork. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] examined it, but the item was from the gods and was wildly beyond their comprehension. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stepped forward, cast the spell on Augrey, and learned that opening the bottle would lead to a bad outcome. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested that they put the vial away before something bad happened. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] ignored them and held it up to the light ot get a better view. Examining it closer, they got an intense urge to shake it. Doing so changed the colour of the inside from an inky black to a pearl white. )

(x:: Seeing that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] didn't have it in him to cast Augury again, they asserted the best thing to do was to get some rest before and then look into the bottle more. Whatever happened with it, it would be best to take it at full strength. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] let out a sigh of relief. )

(x:: Exiting the cave, they returned to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] and found a safe spot to set up camp. They all awoke the next morning, saw slightly better, and returned to full health. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly grabbed the vial and, surrounded by their [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|companions]], uncorked the bottle. As soon as they did so, their bodies crumpled to the ground, completely asleep. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] rushed over, pulling them up and shouting at them to wake up, to no avail. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awoke on a bed. Their entire body was lying on cushions made of duck feathers and silk. Aware they were most likely in [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]]'s domain, they slowly opened their eyes and looked around without drawing too much attention. When they knew the coast was clear, they slowly got up. )

(x:: The place they found themselves was strange and bewildering. The ground did not feel solid but stayed firm beneath each footstep. The smell wasn't familiar but not recognisable, and the sounds felt simultaneously muffled and clear. )

(x:: Cast in a hazy hue, their soundings were simple, with many people around them sleeping on similar beds to theirs. Following the path with their eyes, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s gaze fell upon the impossibly large castle. Looking around, hungry for information, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s body almost unintentionally moved towards the nearest sleeper to wake them up for clues. Shackling them awake, the common woke in confusion and fear, splurting out, "What?! Is it time to wake up?")

(x:: Intrigued, Halbfie asked what they had to be awakened for, but was seriously disappointed when they were told it was for work. Looking around, the commoner began to panic, asking where they were and where their family was. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], colder than they ever meant to reply, stated they were most likely in the Slumbering Vial. The common had no idea what or where the place was and began to panic before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly told them this was a bad dream and to wake up. The common was fast asleep after directing them to go back to 'sleep'. With little else to do, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] continued through the plane until they came to the castle. )

(x:: They could see people playing music and being generally merry from the outside. No one was on watch, so they walked in freely. The castle was empty apart from one large room filled with star-like structures surrounding a large purple crystal. The crystal held a vision within [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], Aidan, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] floating in space around the view, before they slowly ebbed into the dark as the view is pulled into a bright white light [^2]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had no idea what this was showing, but something profound inside them remembered and stored the memory unfolding before them.  )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] instinctively shouted out to their fellow party members, but none seemed to hear or react to their calls. Unsure what to do, they grabbed their notebook and began writing, but each word came out as a twisted imitation of itself. Giving up, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] edged closer to the crystal, as if it was calling them. )

(x:: Looking into the crystal more, they found it now showing a scene they didn't recognise again. This time, it showed from a third-person perspective, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] working together in a Chicken Noodle restaurant. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was elated at seeing one of their dreams come true. After watching the scene, they suddenly noticed a strange figure slumped on one table. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried reaching out to the person and instantly felt their perspective shift to being next to them in the restaurant. The shift would have alarmed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], but it felt natural, like something strange in a usual dream.)

(x:: The person at the table awoke suddenly, revealing themselves to a lady with deep and dark eye bags. Her voice seemed to reverberate through the air with authority even amongst the frequent yawns. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they had just woken up, to which [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] replied, "I'm constantly awake and asleep. I am all that happens between the living hours.")

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] remarked that they understand; most of the time, they struggle to wake up in the morning, especially when it's very early. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] smirked, noting they seemed more drawn to this place than most. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] commented that many gods seemed to reach out to them and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], and assuming the person informed of them was really [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|somnora]], that would be another checked off the list. )

(x:: [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] nodded, saying, "At the end of every day, you know...That I am here. However hard your day, however long, however painful, you know that I'm always here. I will always be here for your species, for your people, for... your planets. I will always provide a safe space. What would you say I am?")

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], after a moment of thought, simply said, "inevitability?" )

(x:: [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], slightly taken aback, quickly changed the subject, mentioning how many of their friends seemed to be worried for [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Gesturing to heaven, the world went quiet. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had begun to hear their [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|companions]] shouting their name repeatedly. Sad they had to leave so quickly after arriving, they started making an awkward farewell. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] passively said, "It's ok, maybe next time you'll remember")

(x:: Confused, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked what they were talking about. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] explained, "We've met before, we'll meet again. Please tell your Party to thank me. For warning them")

(x:: There was a moment of confusion before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] linked what [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] was talking about [^3], immediately stepping back and thanking them for their help. And asked if there was any way [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] could properly thank her for her help. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] simply requested that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] leave some Lavender at their altar when possible. Plants don't really grow where they live, and they love flowers. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] nodded and returned to the waking world. )
