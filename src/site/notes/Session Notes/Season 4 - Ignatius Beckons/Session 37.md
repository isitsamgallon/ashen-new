# Session Summary 
The party, upon reaching the fortified walls near Camp Sophia, made a series of alarming discoveries. Using divine senses and sharp observation, they uncovered that the guards’ armour seemed to have its own agency—likely magical or sentient, possibly binding the wearers against their will. Despite the tense atmosphere, they extracted critical information from the Clerk about the fractured desert militaries and the history of the Great Wall, learning that the wall's magic might connect back to the imprisoned being Terathra. After a tense but humorous departure, they decided to continue toward Oceanvale, encountering unexpected resistance from a hostile druid in the forest. Following a heated battle, Korrigan realised he had dreamt of this druid, Sylva Riverstone, who then agreed to join their cause after a heartfelt and chaotic trip into the Feywild.

Through conversations with Sylva, Korrigan opened up about his death, the deal with Lorwyn, his new goals, and his fractured memories of Lost Haven. The two shared an emotional bond strengthened by past friendship and the mutual desire to bring down the oppressive powers harming the world and Terathra itself. With Sylva now part of the team, the party travelled onward to Tulan Fort, encountering brutal scenes of forced combat and shocking cruelty. Drache and Halfbie proposed a creative solution: sparking a workers' revolt against the fort's corrupt leadership by magically influencing the guards to unionise.

Their plan initially succeeded until Korrigan was caught casting a spell, exposing the group’s involvement. A towering figure recognised Drache and immediately sounded the alarm, triggering chaos as the fort's warriors turned their bloodied and brutalised aggression toward the party. Now cornered and vastly outnumbered, the party braced for an intense battle against overwhelming odds.

# Full Session Notes
(x::With a quick smile at the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] used his divine senses to see if anything interesting was in the area. Alongside the usual Fae, Celestial, and Fiend readings, he detected a significant presence of Undead. He quickly gathered everyone aside to notify them of his findings. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took this opportunity to reveal that the guards at the wall were wearing armour that "didn't seem to have their best interests at heart." Many party members looked confused until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pointed out that the armour could behave this way only if it were sentient or magical.)

(x::Upon hearing this, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suggested using his spell, Protection from Evil and Good, on one of the guards to determine if the armour was possessed. However, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] immediately rejected the idea, arguing that casting unknown spells on formidable warriors could lead to disastrous consequences—at best, they would be seen as aggressive and imprisoned; at worst, they could be killed on the spot. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] quickly understood their concerns and abandoned his plan, proudly stating that he had learned his lesson.)

(x::Aiden returned to the Clerk to ask if they had any information on Shoni Anaphora. Without a word, the Clerk began flipping through his old scrolls, revealing they were in luck. Though the records were usually poorly maintained, Shoni was quite famous in the area, and her record was better preserved. The Clerk informed Aiden that she had returned to [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] a few years ago and could be found in [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]]. When Aiden asked if he knew where [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]] was, the Clerk smirked and told the rogue it was still by the river, as it always had been.)

(x::The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] joined in on the laughter, with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 's hearty chuckle rising above the others as he commented on how typically towns moved around. Once the laughter died, the Clerk explained that [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]] was much harder to relocate than other places due to its significant military presence. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's interest was piqued at this mention, prompting him to ask whether this military was [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] 's Military or belonged to someone else. The Clerk sighed in irritation and clarified that [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] had no unified force; not even [[Groups & Factions/The Watchers\|The Watchers]] could be termed a "unified force." He likened it to the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]], which had a cohesive military presence. At this, a few guards snickered before quickly regaining their composure.)

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] ignored them and asked who commanded these forces if no unified groups were in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]]. The Clerk explained that several large [[Groups & Factions/Nomad Families\|Nomad Families]] each maintained their own guards and armies on retainer. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then inquired if their role was to prevent another Sundering should it occur. He asked whether they regularly checked places like [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the Broken Throne. The Clerk responded that they had no part in that and mostly left it to external researchers, adding, "We used to, but for reasons, people stay here.")

(x::Curious, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked what those reasons were. The Clerk replied, "Well, [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] 's quite unstable nowadays. Many families aren't as powerful as they once were, so a lot of the militaries that kept it safe are gone, and... Other reasons.")

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] couldn't resist asking if the actual reason had to do with the guards' armour. This question caused the tension in the room to become palpable. However, the Clerk refused to answer. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] complained that they had asked very nicely. The Clerk blinked twice before lowering his voice and said, "Tell no one I told you this; ah, well, the armour keeps the soldiers here; it kind of links them to the wall.")

(x::The Clerk seemed surprised at his own revelation and leaned back defensively, refusing to answer [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's next question about the armour's origin. Trying to hide their disappointment, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] casually mentioned that the armour likely didn't have the wearer's best interests at heart and probably kept them there against their will. Suddenly, the Clerk became defensive, asking who would say they were there against their will. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] bluntly replied, "Me? Like, two seconds ago," completely missing the point.)

(x::The Clerk insisted that the guards wanted to be there, which only confused [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] further. When they pressed for a reason why they would want to be there, especially given the job's lack of pay and security, the Clerk sternly stated, "That's confidential.")

(x::An awkward silence fell upon [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] as they struggled to figure out how to proceed. Suddenly, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] perked up and asked the Clerk what his favourite soup was. The Clerk, slightly puzzled, replied that his favourite was chicken. "Perfect!" exclaimed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who then began jotting down notes in a small journal labelled "Market Research for Restaurant." They thanked the Clerk for his time and left, having exhausted their questions.)

(x::In an uncharacteristic move, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] approached the Clerk to shake his hand. In reality, they were trying to sneak a glance at what the Clerk was writing on his scrolls. Two scrolls were laid out on the desk; one appeared to be of significant importance.)

(x::"Speaking of the wall, who built it?" asked an intrigued [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]].)

(x::"It was a combined effort from [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|the coalition]] and was planned out by the Grand Architect," explained the Clerk.)

(x::"Ah yes, we're familiar," replied [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] without a second thought.)

(x::The Clerk looked up, intrigued for the first time in the conversation, expressing his amazement, as very few had met the Grand Architect. Curious, the Clerk asked what the architect was like. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that they were a nice "person," with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly adding that they were quick to anger but still very friendly, and the rest nodded in agreement. The Clerk surmised that, as a genius, the architect was probably allowed to be that way. Seeking more information, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] said, "Yeah, probably. It's a shame what he did to that poor creature...")

(x::The Clerk's face stiffened as he asked what they were discussing, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was already halfway out of the office. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] leaned on the desk and said in a coy tone, "You know, we could explain what that was, but only if you tell us a bit more about the armor...")

(x::The Clerk hesitated before explaining that he couldn't speak any more on the matter, going as far as to say it would kill him if he did explain further. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaimed that this was unfortunate before strutting out of the room. However, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly reappeared to ask if the Clerk wanted the door left open or closed. The Clerk asked for it to be left as it was found, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] confidently replied, "Open," and left.)

(x::Once out of earshot but still being watched from afar, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exhaled, pleased that they had learned so many interesting things. They were particularly intrigued by the fact that Niaross significantly influenced the wall and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]], which could mean [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]] had something to do with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tried to sense Terathera's presence from the wall but couldn't detect anything. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], looking closer at the wall and then The [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]], tried to understand if anything was happening. As far as they could tell, the stone had been taken from the mountain range, but it was nothing more than regular rock. After a long pause, they assessed that it was probably sedimentary rock, but no geologists were around.)

(x::The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] didn't get the chance to ask what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was talking about; they quickly began walking down the path toward Tulan Fort, muttering under their breath about how geologists weren't real scientists. Suddenly, one of them opened their pack, retrieved a map for the Tour Du Ashen, and explained that their next stop was likely Tulan Fort unless they wanted to return to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]] to check out the goblins outside of it. They decided to continue to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] and possibly check out Tulan along the way.)

(x::Making good time through a wooded area, most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] was not paying attention until suddenly, a long stick flew out of nowhere, thudding into [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 's chest. After a moment of shock, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] jumped into action. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast Mage Armor on themselves and conjured an illusionary box for cover when they saw a second arrow fly from the tree line. With a brief moment of reprieve, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at the arrows and realised they were most likely tree branches that had been magically augmented to act as arrows.)

(x::Taking command, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] told [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to charge into the forest once they signalled. The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] nodded in agreement as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned to the source of the arrows and began to cast Fireball. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] watched as a mote of fire started to form in their hands before suddenly disappearing and being replaced by what could only be described as a pure magical force. Noticing everyone's confused expressions, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they didn't want to burn the forest down with an accidental fire. The rest looked at [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] before agreeing that this was for the best. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then threw the mote of force into the forest, creating a massive explosion and clearing out a few enemies and a portion of the forest for them to fight. They then gave the signal, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] rushed in.)

(x::Unbeknownst to them, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] was attacked by a Druid and a pack of wolves. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's Fireball had killed a few of the wolves, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] finished off the others. The druid proved more difficult, firing bows from the cover of trees and bushes. Eventually, they cornered the druid using [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's Web spell. Just as [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was about to hit the druid, it Wild Shaped into a large spider and began to fight back with fangs and poison. Eventually, the druid was defeated, with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ensuring that it wasn't killed, as he seemed to recognise the druid, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] Riverstone, from his dreams as his "friend.")

(x::Once they realised this, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] healed her back to health so they could chat. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] exclaimed that he had seen [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] in his dreams and had been worried about her; she coyly remarked that if he missed her so much that he dreamed about her, he should've gotten in contact sooner. When asked, she explained that she was attached because these were her woods, and most of the people who ventured through weren't very kind and often tried to kill the animals around them. )

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained to the group that they used to work together on the other side of the mountain, close to the board of the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. She must've travelled down to this forest afterwards, which would explain why they hadn't run into each other since they had been down to this region before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] elaborated by saying she moved here when the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]] cut down their tree house, which outrages [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who had wanted to go to one ever since they were little and even offered to help Sylvia get revenge. Before they knew it, they had all decided to go and get revenge, with Sylvia taking it one step further and announcing that they should kill all the fruit Cutter for all the crimes they committed. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] was less enthusiastic about this; however, it was easily convinced. )

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wanted to join as he reasoned that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] was fighting them for a reason but didn't want to kill everyone. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if Sylvia had ever run into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], but she had no clue who that was. Hlafbie revealed they thought every woman knew every other woman. They quickly explained that their mother knew everyone in their home town when Sylia glared at them for such a sexist remark. However, when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] came to mention their home town, their voice trailed off as they realised they did not know where this was [^5]. )

(x::Feeling the awkward silence, Sylvia asked what they were all doing in her woods. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] simply stated that they were on the Tour Du Ashen as if that cleared everything up, much to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's enjoyment. He complained about how nerdy he sounded to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] smirked and told Sylvia that the name and plan were his ideas and he wouldn't want to take credit for them. )

Through blushing red cheeks and after a loud laughter from Sylvia, Kerrigan explained from the beginning how they came to be exploring and on their way to [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. 

(x::"Do you know [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]?" he asked, nodding to Sylvia, "Well, I died in a fight with a Wyvern, and now [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] has a new [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]].  AND LOOK, NOW I HAVE HORNS." )

"That's slightly concerning, but we put you in charge." remarked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]].

(x::"Yeah... Also, I remember nothing before the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]." said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], "She rebuilt my body. She probably did some stuff to my brain too, but I'm all good. I'm all good.")

(x::"So she rebuilt your body so it's not your original body?" questioned [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]].)

"Well is the ship still the same ship if you replaced each and every party?" [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] counted, quite pleased that he knew about [The Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) paradox.

"No" she replied bluntly. 

"Well... Then this isn't [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]," replied [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 

(x::"yeah yeah, im a crude copy of my past self. I can take you to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]; that should help clear up a few things." said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] )

(x::Before the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] could firmly reject the idea based on past experiences, Sylvia agreed with a smirk, and they both disappeared. When Sylvia opened her eyes, she found herself in a quiet part of a meadow where he once made his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He invited her to sit down and admire the view of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. She sat down, amazed by its untamed beauty. After a few moments, she turned to him, and with a coy smile, she asked, "We're you really that desperate to get some alone time with me?")

(x::Kerrigan began to stutter through a sentence about how he just wanted to show her rather than try to explain it with words. She then asked about his death and to explain it in more detail. "Oh, um, we were heading to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]], and this little bitch called Merrick the Wise decided to disturb a dragon, or wyvern, and the wyvern got angry and killed me." He explained.)

"I guess that's a cool way to go out," she murmured. 

"Yeah..?" said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], not quite sure how to answer. 

"Then you ended up here?" She asked

(x::"Yeah, I appeared here, and [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] came up to me, and we made a deal", Kerrigan explained. )

"Wait, you made a deal with a God?" she exclaimed in alarm, "Are you thick? Actually, don't answer that. I know you're thick."

(x::"Yep. I am... I am streetwise. I'm not smart, actually; I'm not very streetwise, either." [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] said, "I like puzzles. I like figuring things out. Oh! Speaking of, did I tell you anything about [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]?")

"I believe you mentioned it briefly, but you were quite mysterious about the details. You shared that you're from there and hinted at having killed several people but didn't elaborate much. I'm still not sure about the whole story." She answered.

(x::"I ask because I can't remember. Part of my deal involved unfinished business at [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. I made the deal to go back and finish that unfinished business I've lost. In return, I am [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], and I do some really funny stuff - like, did you see the horse?! Its always angry and wants to eat [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]] and i can summon it!!" explained [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] excitedly.)

"I did see the horse. I do remember you used to talk about your sleep. You used to see stuff about A revolution against some king or something and see your dad. She said.

"Oh yeah, I want to kill the king as well," he interjected. 

"you said something about, yeah, your friend, some girl or something; you kept mentioning her name or whatever. It's a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] weird, but whatever, I'm not jealous." she stated.

(x::Kerrigan confirmed this, saying that her name, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]], was one of the few people he remembered after his new role. He then explained that his new goal was to head up to [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] with his party, and she was more than welcome to join them, saying it would be like old times. Sylvia agreed to join them, stating that [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was known for polluting a lot, and it would be good to stop that by killing the king and killing everyone involved in destroying the environment. )

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ignored her alarming comments and instead focused on telling her all about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and how they were sealed away and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] were hurting them. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that one of his goals in [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was to destroy the tower. Sylvia initially didn't believe him until he showed her the book he stole from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], which explained everything to her. After reading the book, she was immediately on board and wanted to help. )

(x::Excited to be adventuring with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]] again, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] jumped up, teleported them to the temple, and excitedly showed her his statute. She thought it was cool, but she wanted one herself. )

(x::They soon returned to the human realm, where Sylvia began to breathe heavily to try and make it look like they had been having sex while in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. This made everyone laugh, leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] confused and asking if they had gone on a long run or something. Much to the other amusement and pity)

(x::"Is there like a 400-meter running track in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] or something?" questioned a very confused [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]])

"You'll learn a lot about this when you're older." said [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] [^6]

"There's plenty of books on it. I've got some if you want them." remarked Sylvia, and much to everyone's horror, she handed [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a book called the ' [Kama Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_Sutra) ' 

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly signalled for the group to continue their journey and attempted to steal the book when no one was watching, wanting to protect the elf's innocence. They all climbed into the carriage and travelled until they reached the gates of [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], where they could hear distant sounds of people training hard. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to open the door, only to find it locked, which everyone presumed was for the best. However, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was determined to see what was happening inside the fort and found a spot to peer through some cracks in the wall.)

(x::To his horror, he saw that they were all training, but the exercises were all brutal and barbaric. There were groups of people punching rock and stone, crying in pain with the thud of their bloody fists against the stone. On the other side of the camp was a massive combat ring where people were fighting to the death with real weapons. The floor was soaked in blood, and many of the bodies were lying either in piles or on the floor. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] declared that something had to be done as this wasn't right. )

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] agreed, stating that this couldn't go on and they should inform [OSHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration) about this as they began to write down all the violations they saw. 

(x::They devised a plan for [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to use their Suggestion spell to influence them to unionise and revolt against their new leadership. They convinced a guard leaning against the wall to run off to start their revolution. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then tried to do the same but was caught casting a spell on another guard. The giant stood up to see what was happening before shouting, "EVERYONE [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|DRACHE]] AND HIS MATES ARE BACK, KILL 'EM!!")


# Trivia & Notes
