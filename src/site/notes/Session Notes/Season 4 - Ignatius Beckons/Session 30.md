# Session Summary 
Korrigan severs his connection to Terathra and returns to Malin, who solemnly accepts his fate, requesting a quick death to avoid Ignatius' wrath. After discussing the history of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] and their purpose, Korrigan, without hesitation, executes Malin with an arrow to the head, shocking the party but justifying it as a means to buy time before Ignatius discovers their plans. Halfbie then attempts to remove a crystal from the temple walls, but an error results in an explosion, sending them through a rift and stranding them in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Panic sets in among the group as Korrigan struggles to track Halfbie’s whereabouts, eventually deducing they were trapped in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] due to a malfunction with [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]]. Desperate to find them, Korrigan teleports to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], where he discovers Halfbie—aged and frail—having spent what felt like centuries lost in the shifting, chaotic realm.

Halfbie’s time in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] was a lonely, harrowing ordeal. After wandering for decades and losing himself to routine survival, he found brief solace in a kind Autumn [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]]’s home, where he stayed for months before continuing his journey. The passage of time stretched endlessly, and he soon found himself lost for over 700 years. Eventually, Halfbie stumbled upon a golden temple—an unmoving structure in an ever-shifting realm. It was there that he finally reunited with Korrigan, who had arrived moments before. Halfbie, confused and exhausted, presented Korrigan with his tally-marked notebook, detailing the relentless march of time in a place where reality itself was unstable. The two embraced before Korrigan transported them back to the material plane, where the rest of the party greeted Halfbie with concern and relief.

The party then departed the temple, gathering information about the Prince of Fire and his legendary magical artefacts before continuing their journey. They made camp near Whitespire, where Drache and Korrigan had a deep conversation about morality, their actions, and the burdens of leadership. Drache struggled with guilt over Malin’s death and questioned the righteousness of their path. Later, Halfbie and Aidan’s watch led to a tense discussion about their pasts, with Aidan revealing his upbringing as an experiment of the Black Cult. The next morning, they encountered the Inchling Kingdom—a tiny civilization within mushroom homes. They befriended Dill Billington and Big Dave, learned about Inchling culture, and even participated in a feast. The whimsical encounter provided a rare moment of levity before they continued their journey.

# Full Session Notes
(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ends the connection between him and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and returns to the cavern. In a slight daze, they return to face [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], who stands to the side with his head bowed respectfully. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awkwardly asks if this is when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants to do it, and if so, does he have a way he wants to go? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] says that he doesn't really care as long as it is painless and soon, so he won't have to deal with the fiery explosions that come with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' return. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is confused, wondering why he would want to die now as surely he would be sent straight to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], who was bound to be furious with the priest. )

(x:: Although [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is the God of Fire and Cleansing, he is also the God of Violence and War. When his soldiers and followers die, their souls get sent to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s eternal battlefield, where they fight a myriad of monsters, demons and beasts. Moderates who had given up on war go to the same place but are put in a separate area, which is covered in fire, and people are in great pain. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is the general of his army and is too busy to come to see the moderates, so it is believed that even though the existence will be painful, it will be peaceful. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] whispers to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], wondering if it might be better to Kill [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] with Ice magic so he won't be as affected by the fire in the bad place. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] didn't respond.)

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.)

(x:: Looking slightly pissed off now, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] surmises that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants them to destroy the tower and then kill him so he doesn't have to deal with the fallout - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] agrees. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] analyses the tower and notes that the crystal isn't at the centre of it like the others. Instead, the crystals line the walls and focus on the tower. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] touches on them, and a husky and laboured voice whispers to him, "[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]." [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s head snaps in the direction of the voice, and it is one of the black wraiths they saw in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordacai also recognise them from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked about The Tower, noting its distinct difference from the other towers before becoming slightly confused about what [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] were. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he was here before The Tower or Temple was built. Before the temple was around, there was nothing, just an empty plane. Then, a crystal crashed on this land, causing an enormous crater. Sometime after, A dragon appeared, and she explained she would use the crystal to ensure [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] wouldn't happen again. The people, still mourning the loss of their friends and family, desperately agreed. The dragon spent months and months building something that could use the crystal. Eventually, he was successful and went around the world using fragments of the crystal to build more towers all over. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] and the other priests soon gathered around to protect it, creating a church over it to hide it from [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] and anyone who might have bad intentions.)

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asks if they do kill him, will they be hunted down for his death? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explains that this room is rarely used and is not known to many people. Additionally, many of the staff do not enter the different rooms dedicated to the Gods; they would not know he was dead for many weeks or even months. After [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked, he confirmed that the number of people, excluding [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], who knew of this room could be counted on one hand. Without a moment's hesitation, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] drew his bow and shot [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] in the head. The arrow buried deep in the priest's eye, threatening to come out the other side. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] crumpled to the floor, dead instantly. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained to the shocked members of his party that killing him now would ensure that no one related to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] would ever be able to find out about The Tower and would serve to buy them time. They admitted he had a point, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and Aidan were annoyed that none were given a say.)

While this happens, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] analyses the crystal and determines that it can be removed carefully. He tries to do so, being as careful as possible, but he messes it up, leading to the explosion of the crystal. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] questions them on why they're trying to do this as it seems impossible; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains that it's possible and it could allow them to understand [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] better and give them an advantage in the war.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suggests they both use their [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] abilities to move it. Both of them grab onto the crystal and activate their abilities; [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] teleports a few feet from the wall with one half in his hand, instantly exploding. However, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is nowhere to be found. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is now incredibly corned that one of their party members may be missing - especially one surrounded by so much mystery; he demands to know where [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] began to panic, unsure where to search for their missing friend. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], unsure and screamed that this would normally be something [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] would be left to solve. 

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to calm him down and told him to start from the beginning and explain how their [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] works. After a few deep breaths, they explained that their version works slightly differently from the more common version. He functions by taking him through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s before appearing in the spot he wanted. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] paused for a moment before suggesting that maybe their ability malfunctioned and sent [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] but left them there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] filed with his bow for a moment before saying that could be the case as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no way out of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and so could be trapped. A moment passed for [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s eyes widened in panic as he screamed, "OH MY GOD, [[The Party/Halfbie\|HALFBIE]] IS IN THE [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|FEYWILD]]!" before teleporting there himself. He landed in his usual spot: outside a golden temple dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He threw out his magic, searching for this friend and breathed a sigh of relief, and he sensed them moving to them slowly. )

Looking up, they saw an old man covered in dirt and crime, covered in a burlap sack that was being used as a cloak for worms. They looked malnourished and unkept as a long whisper; white beards trailed on the floor between their legs.

#### Halfbie's POV
(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] opened their eyes after the teleport, only to find themselves in a dense forest that they instantly recognised as the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. They checked the crystal to see if the plan at least worked, but in the hand was what looked to be a small rift that seemed to cut the very fabric of reality. Inside, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could see an inky black void that contained thousands of tiny stars and galaxies. More importantly, there was a weird magical session that sounded like a rift. On further analysis, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] realised in horror that magic was being sucked into the rift. Knowing that if too much magic was absorbed, there could be catastrophic consequences for not just the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] but the universe as a whole. Their worries were soon halted when they realised that the rift was quickly closing, and after a minute, the rift had disappeared. It was as if magic was repairing the rift, and as it wasn't that significant, it was a relatively quick fix.)

(x:: With the rift resolved, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned their attention to their next problem: how they were going to leave the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. They were anxious to leave, as they were well aware of the dangers of these lands. They recognised the general area but weren't sure they knew exactly where they were. They decided to pick a direction and walk; theoretically, they should run into someone or some settlement at some point. Travelling through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s, they managed to stay safe through clever spellwork and ingenuity, surviving on berries or whatever animals they could hunt. The animals of the Fey were strange and almost uncanny like they either should exist or some mad scientist fused what they assumed two different animals should be like as the days turned into weeks, into months and months into years. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s mind began to unravel as they walked around aimlessly in the fairest way that would not stop moving and shifting. It was as if the very ground beneath them breathed, and the trees turned to look whenever they made a sound. )

After 20 years, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had become too accustomed to this world and lost himself in the routine of hunting, forging and wandering aimlessly. However, one day, they came across a wooden hut occupied by a beautiful Autumn Eldarin. The Eldarin smiles kindly and invites them in for some food, offering a bowl of hearty chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was grateful and accepted, not caring that this would put them in debt to a fey creature. They devoured many bowls of the soup before passing out on the floor. They awoke in a comfy bed to a spell of bacon on eggs being fried up for breakfast. The Eldarin looked up from the cast iron pan and invited them to stay for breakfast. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s mind, now refreshed, gladly accepted and asked how they could repay their debt. The Eldarin initially refused any payment but eventually relented and said they would be grateful for work around the house, like cleaning and feeding the animals outside. 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly got work as they used various magics to clean the house until even the old wooden walls looked brand new. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] collected their things and began to leave before they were stopped by the Eldarin, who grabbed their arm, offering them a bed and food for a few months in return for help around the house and other...help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who missed their meaning, thanked them profusely but explained that they had to go, their friends were waiting for them, and they had to return soon. The Eldarin looked saddened but told them to wait a moment before returning inside quickly. He appeared again just as quickly with a large burlap sack they had fashioned soon into a cloak, expelling that it would help keep them warm at night. With a caring hand on their shoulder, the Eldarin wished them safe travel and hoped they would one day return. 

They carried on their march but soon became lost again. This time, they did not find another part of civilisation for over 700 years. They ran into many people who seemed to be stuck in the same situation as him - lost with their minds unravelling with every step they took. One day off in the distance, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] spotted a large golden structure, which notably did not move. They immediately didn't trust this as they came to know that the world moving around was normal, so seeing something staying still was now a strange and foreign experience. Nonetheless, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s inquisitive mind got the better of them, and they decided to investigate. Clutching onto their stuff for support, they slowly began to make their way over. Their moments and strength had weakened in their old age, but they were determined to learn more. 

At first, they circled around the temple slowly before they spotted a horned humanoid with a large bow on their back. They moved in closer, and the figure seemed very familiar; when it clicked, this was their friend, The Kal [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]. They rushed over as fast as their frail body would allow them to. Strangely, as they got closer, they began to move faster and faster until they were running over to their friend. Their body seemed to age as they got closer to their old friend. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] turned to them with confusion and then later shock as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] hugged their friend tight. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] pulled away after a moment and asked what had happened and why they were so old before. Had they been trapped here for a long time? 

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thought for a moment before opening an old and ratty notebook. As they flicked through the pages, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] watched in horror as each one was filled with tally marks. They covered every surface of the page and seemed to get increasingly hectic and incoherent as they fluttered by. Each one clearly told the story of a person slowly losing themselves in making the marks. A lot of the pages were also covered in blood, which [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] could only hope wasn't [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] takes them inside the temple, ensuring [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gets a proper meal before leaving the plane. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was grateful for the meal, although a little disappointed that it was chicken Noodle Soup. After finishing their meal, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] called an aid and told them to give his regards to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] before grabbing [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and transporting them back to the human realm. )

(x:: When they returned, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] rushed to greet [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who explained his experience to them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked if the crystal vanished when they arrived at the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], as he didn't see it on them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] couldn't remember, so he flicked back through their notebook and was delighted to see they had kept a journal for the first 15 years. The journal detailed their rift to everyone, and as they read it, the memory came back to them, and they explained the situation in more detail. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tries to lighten the mood and asks if they learned anything interesting on their travels, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] replies with a massive grin, "Stew and noodles are real goodddd!!".)

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan. )

(x:: As they're leaving, they ask the receptionist if they have any information on the Prince of Fire. They do, and after a short search, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are handed a book called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Pyromancer’s Legacy - The Chronicles of Kaelis Ignithar\|The Pyromancer’s Legacy - The Chronicles of Kaelis Ignithar]]. The Prince of Fire: The Life and Legacy of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis Ignithar]] tells the story of Kaelis, a fire genasi from the Ember Wastes who became a legendary arcanist in the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]]. Renowned for his mastery of pyromancy, Kaelis authored The Pyromantic Codex and created groundbreaking spells like Fireball and Fire Storm, revolutionising fire magic and advancing the empire’s industry. However, Grayfall’s oppression of humans sparked a rebellion, leading to its downfall. During the empire’s final battle, Kaelis vanished, with some claiming he perished in the flames and others believing he escaped with its knowledge. His legacy lives on through his teachings, artefacts like the Everburning Crown, and the enduring embers in Grayfall’s ruins, ensuring his flame continues to inspire future generations.)

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] states that the Everburning Crown sounds very similar to [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] but was unable to find a solid connection in the book. Leaving the temple, they have an amazing time and make it to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]] before lunch. passing the town guards wearing orange armour could be signed with logos and insignias that they were too far away to make out truly.)

(x:: Passion [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered two men in incredibly fashionable and interesting clothing [^1]. The two men have a lunch caravan with huge piles of colourful silk. The men stop and proudly ask if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] would be interested in investing in their futures. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] falls for them and says they would. The men introduce themselves as businessmen for [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]] and begin to describe the concept of silk to them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is quick on the uptake and says they're quite familiar with silk, mostly the fabric made in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The men admit that this silk isn't as nice as their Elvin silk, but it is a lot cheaper than the stuff from the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]]. )

(x:: The men also say they can make the silk a lot faster, so it would be a great investment into their social standing. "The clothes maketh the man". [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knows that this is theoretically possible as you can produce silk faster and cheaper, but it would involve mistreating the silkworms, a treatment that would often result in the death of the worms. Elvin is often much nicer as they take the time to extract the silk without harming the worm, resulting in a better product. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions this, and the men quickly look at each other, stating that their worms are special and can handle this. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] steps and tells the men they're wasting their time as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] doesn't have the money to invest or buy nice fabrics. The men are annoyed that they wasted their time, but before leaving, they say they would be willing to give them some of the fabric, they would sell it from them. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] would make some money and then pay a fee to the businessmen. they produced a magic contract stating it was to make them get their money back. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] looks horrified at the state of the magic contract and tells them to no before walking on, instructing the rest of  [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to do the same. )


#### Korrigan & Drache's Watch 
(x:: It is late afternoon when they arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] is nervous about being around the area with Aidan's possession and their last interaction with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]' staff [^2]. They all decide to walk around the town and make camp in the forest nearby. Still mentally exhausted, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says it might not be worth it to use their Tiny Hut spell and have a night watch like normal. They all agree. while figuring out watch partners, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is insistent that he watches with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], who happily accepts. With everyone asleep, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] is eager to carry on their training, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] refuses, stating that he has a few things he wants to talk about. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] expresses that he feels incredibly lost at the moment; their adventures feel incredibly chaotic, and they're finding themselves incredibly lost with what is happening. At the start, this was fine as it meant he could focus on the fighting and defending, but not it becoming too much. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is also feeling very guilty about the death of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]].)

(x:: [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] admits their adventures have become a lot of offers to try and dig out some of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris']] old notes to help explain some of what's going on. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] seems quite happy with this. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] addresses the priest, saying that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] should have no reason to feel guilty about the priest as that was all [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] had nothing to do with it. He mostly did it because it allowed them to buy some more time before [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] happened again. )

(x:: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] agrees to an extent with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s reasoning but still feels bad, especially because he keeps being put on this pedestal as the group's moral compass, with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] going as far as to say that '[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the last truly good person left' [^3]. Yet every day, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] keeps doing morally grey, or sometimes just objectively bad things. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] argues that they may do bad things, but overall, they are fighting to ensure that the world can keep going. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is unsure if the ends justify the means with everything they have done. )

(x:: After a deep breath, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that in their party, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is possessed by a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|war criminal]], Aidan is possessed by a God, another may share a body with a dead party member, and he is [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s toy. Weird or even bad things are bound to happen, but they're trying their best to make sure that the world is ok. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is still sad because, in his eyes, he isn't this paragon of good that everyone says he is. Like everyone, he has done bad things, sometimes for the greater good and sometimes for selfish reasons, making him feel like a fake and he is sick of pretending. )

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stood up and insisted that they talk and train together, stating it would help clear their minds and make them feel like they're still being productive. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] reluctantly aggresses and stands up with his great axe. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explains that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is a good person, and he challenges the injustices within the world with his rage, channelling it into fighting for people. He reminds [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] that they're trying to do good and better the world, which should always be noted in a world that is not kind to its people. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] half agrees but says he is worried that one day, that rage will build up so much that one day it might be released on someone or something that doesn't deserve it. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tells him to try and focus on the good he is doing in the world. It's like the anger and bad are fuelling all of his good acts, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is unsure of this.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then suddenly punches [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and continues to do so as [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] refuses to cheer up. Eventually, Draches mad and flies into a rage. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], unless a shot from his bow at the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], before the arrow hits its mark, a golden magic sound [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] absorbs the energy, sending the damage back onto [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]. The sound of this happening is deafening, waking everyone up. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], through the pain, shouts that this is what his rage is able to do; he can do what no one else can; he can protect people and hurt those who do bad. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], seeing that things could get dangerous if this continues, steps in and reasons that this might be a great time to change watch. 

#### Halfbie and Aidan's Watch
During a night watch, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan find themselves responsible for maintaining vigilance due to their darkvision capabilities. As they are the only members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] with this ability, they remain alert to their surroundings. Their watch becomes tense when they spot a large, moving brown mass in the distance behind the trees. They stealthily approach a nearby bush for a better vantage point. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] discreetly indicates the mass to Aidan, who struggles to discern what it is in the dense darkness and distance. Aidan speculates that it might be a bear, a theory with which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] concurs. In response to potential danger, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] casts the Alarm spell to prevent any unexpected intrusions.

(x:: The atmosphere shifts to one of awkward silence as Aidan breaks the stillness, inquiring about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s enjoyment of their travels with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] expresses contentment with their adventurous experience alongside interesting companions, although they voice some guilt for having seemingly abandoned their duties with the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] mages. When Aidan seeks clarity on the nature of these duties, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admits their ignorance, stating they were only informed that magic users were needed for an expedition, stirring their desire to leave [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]].)

(x:: Aidan nods, signaling understanding, which prompts [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to directly question Aidan’s tendency towards silence. Aidan reveals that they have always been reticent, finding their adventures overwhelming, and using silence as a means of processing their experiences. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] empathises, noting the diversity within [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] can lead to significant interpersonal conflict. Aidan acknowledges this observation after a brief pause, leading [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to discuss various disputes encountered throughout their journey, including the incident where Aidan killed a [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]][^4]. Aidan’s reaction is one of shock and confusion as they question how [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is aware of that event, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admits to having no knowledge of its implications.)

(x:: Seeking to lighten the mood, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shifts the conversation towards Aidan’s childhood. Aidan stiffens and reveals, “yeahhhh, I don't have parents.” Unaware of Aidan’s discomfort, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] inquires further into the circumstances of Aidan’s upbringing. Aidan explains that they were viewed as an experiment by their parents, who were members of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]], cultivating a sense of anger concerning their past, especially as their life has now become intertwined with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].)

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], half-jokingly, remarks that Aidan’s life story would make for an interesting book, capable of exploring numerous narrative possibilities. However, Aidan expresses a reluctance to delve into autobiographical discussions, citing discomfort with sharing personal experiences in the presence of others [^5].

(x:: An awkward silence ensues before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] enthusiastically redirects the conversation to their quest to perfect the ultimate Chicken Noodle Soup Recipe, inspired by their experiences in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Aidan listens patiently until it is time for their watch to conclude. Attempting to rouse [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], Aidan finds him resistant to wakefulness, leading Aidan to wake [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], who joins the soup-enthusiast Halfbie for the next watch.)

#### Halfbie & [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' Watch
(x:: During a conversation about wealth, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shared their contrasting experiences growing up. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] discussed the living conditions in much of [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], where many individuals reside in tents due to financial hardships. This revelation shocked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]], who found it difficult to fathom sharing such a confined space with others. She noted this experience in her journal, recognizing it as an aspect of life she had not considered prior to leaving the palace.)

(x:: When asked about her journey, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] expressed wonder and gratitude, highlighting how meaningful and enriching the trip had been. She noted her ability to learn new things and discover genuine friendships during her travels. When questioned about her favorite place, she mentioned being struck by the mystery and history of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]], as well as the profound experience of witnessing the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|city]]'s disappearance. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admitted to feeling jealousy over not having witnessed this astonishing sight, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] quickly tempered his excitement by pointing out the grave implications of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]'s vanishing.)

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] emphasized that her most cherished aspect of the adventure was [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Despite the ongoing conflicts and dangers faced by the group, she valued the authentic friendships she had formed, where individuals did not condescend to her or offer unnecessary assistance. She reflected on the limitations of her previous life in the palace, asserting that had she traveled with guards, she would not have experienced the world in its true form.

(x:: Feeling melancholic, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] shared her regret about returning to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], recognizing it as the right choice but lamenting the end of her journey with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] attempted to uplift her spirits by assuring her that they would remain friends and visit her, potentially taking her on smaller adventures. After wiping away a tear, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] shifted the conversation to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s perspective on the journey thus far.)

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], excitedly conjuring stars with their prestidigitation spell, described the trip as incredible and fulfilling. They recounted the joys of enjoying [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s cooking, making friends, and savoring chicken noodle soup. They expressed a desire to continue following their intuition, which seemed to lead them to rewarding experiences.

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], recalling her own family background, inquired about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s parents. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed that they wanted to earn money to support their family in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]]. Although they had limited financial resources, they shared what little they had. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] mentioned her own tragic family history, stating that her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] had passed away shortly after her birth, and she did not know her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|father]] until after his death. )

(x:: [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] described their parents as supportive and kind, though noted their father's strictness made open communication difficult. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] found this discussion poignant, wishing to understand the feeling of familial love she had never experienced. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] struggled to articulate their experiences, comparing it to explaining sight to someone who had never seen. )

(x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] reflected on the irony of their differing backgrounds, noting how those from wealthier families typically enjoy more time with family due to reduced work obligations, while poorer families often face the reverse situation. After a moment of contemplation, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] recognized their upbringing as a rare privilege and suggested they should be grateful for their parents' support.)

#### The Inchling Kingdom
(x:: In the morning, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] approached [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] to apologise for hurting him earlier and thanked him for all the kind words and encouragement from the previous night. During the journey known as the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]], a group referred to as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] embarked on an adventure that led them to an unexpected encounter with an intriguing race known as [[Other Information/Races/Inchlings\|Inchlings]]. This encounter unveiled the cultural and social dynamics of [[Locations/OFC/The Inchling Kingdom\|the Inchling Kingdom]], in addition to providing insight into their lifestyle and customs.)

(x:: The meeting commenced after an awkward pause, when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly inquired whether it was possible to incorporate other meats, such as pork or beef, into chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] kindly explained that culinary creativity has no bounds. At this moment, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]  , upon examining a map of [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]], recalled previous visits to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], where they first learned about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. The group hoped that returning to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] could yield further insights.)

(x:: As they explored the surrounding foliage, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] stumbled upon a large clearing filled with peculiar mushrooms, which appeared to have windows and doors. Upon closer inspection, they discovered that these mushrooms were inhabited by hundreds of tiny people, later identified as [[Other Information/Races/Inchlings\|Inchlings]]. They approached [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], expressing their excitement at seeing taller beings.)

In an attempt to communicate, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] transformed into an ant for easier understanding but ultimately shifted into a horse while on [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s shoulder. However, this sudden transformation caused [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to topple over due to the unexpected weight.

(x:: At this point, a regular-sized human named [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] emerged, holding one of the Inchlings. He introduced himself simply to the group and expressed his astonishment at the presence of others his size. The Inchling he held, [[ Dill Billington\| Dill Billington]], introduced himself with a refined accent, hailing from the prominent Billington family.)

(x:: [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] explained their purpose for being in the territory—travelling through the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Dill Billington\|Dill Billington]], confused by the mention of "Ashen," learned from [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] that it referred to the land they occupied. He did not comprehend that there existed a world beyond their seemingly infinite woods. With careful elaboration, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] conveyed that they were in a significantly larger area, further describing it as an enormous puddle compared to their forest, which left Dill in awe.)

(x:: Curiosity piqued, Dill expressed his desire to witness this larger land. He suggested riding on[[ Bit\| Bit]], and once clarified that Dill and his brother [[ Parsley Billington\| Parsley Billington]] were champions of feather racing, he excitedly hopped onto [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]]'s back while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used the Fly spell to elevate them high into the clouds.)

(x:: As they ascended, Dill initially felt fear but later marvelled at the expansive view below. He wished his parents, [[ Sage Billington\| Sage Billington]] and [[ Cumin Billington\| Cumin Billington]], could share in this experience. Intrigued, he asked [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] about other wonders they could show him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then launched into an enthusiastic monologue about chicken noodle soup.)

(x:: When asked about leisure activities in [[Locations/OFC/The Inchling Kingdom\|the Inchling Kingdom]], Dill admitted they did not engage in sports but highlighted their fishing competition, in which [[ Parsley Billington\| Parsley Billington]] had previously been the reigning champion until [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] arrived. Due to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]]'s popularity, they refrained from imposing a height restriction on the competition. The kingdom operated under a communist structure, allowing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] to efficiently gather food, resulting in a culture of enjoyment for the Inchlings.)

(x:: Upon returning to the ground, the Inchling community expressed relief at Dill's safety, referencing a past incident where his grandmother, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Oregano Billington †\|Oregano Billington †]], was reportedly taken by a bird, causing widespread anxiety surrounding flying. Grateful for their exhilarating experience, Dill invited [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to stay for dinner.)

(x:: Initially hesitant due to assumptions about the kingdom's food supply, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ultimately accepted Dill's invitation. They gathered for a meal, which [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] joined. He explained that the Inchlings primarily consumed fish and berries[^6]. Expressing a desire to assist in cooking, he noted the kitchen staff were not accommodating to his size, humorously unaware of his physical limitations.)

(x:: As the chefs presented a small buffet of tadpoles and berries, many Inchlings utilized toadstools as seating. While the meal offered limited sustenance, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] graciously accepted the food. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was reluctant to sample the tadpoles, while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] found them flavorful, reminiscent of sardines. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] opted solely for the berries, adhering to his preference against consuming animals. Despite the meal’s lightness, Dill offered to let them stay with him, solidifying a budding friendship between the two parties.)
