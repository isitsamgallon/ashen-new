(x:: We start mid combat in [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] where the weird zombie man summoned [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] after stealing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Pages\|The Pages]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] has two pages so he escaped out through the window. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] misty steps to join Drache. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]], while trying to defend [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] gets impaled by the The Ethertwist Haunter and is downed. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] had a moral breakdown and leaves without grabbing Steve, asking someone else to get him because he acknowledges he is a Squishy motherfucker. )

Chenris now has The Pages to keep them away from both the ghost and the haunter. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] and Drache go back to pick up Steve. initially Kal is not strong enough to move Steve more than a few meters before dropping him.

Kal ties up Steve with some rope and attaches it to an arrow & shoots it at Drache who pulls him towards the rest of the team outside the house. He a not racist for once when he wakes up!! 

(x:: Chenris Spiritual Weapon to distract the haunter and give everyone time to get out. Everyone runs for the clearing and gets out of The Not World. Kal burns the house down which summons a bunch of White Robed mages from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], who look at Chenris with distain before putting out the fire.)

--Long Rest--

As the party are resting and are on watch, Mordecai notices but decided to ignore this and go to sleep. Due to some bad rolls, everyone falls a asleep and wakes up stuck in a huge spider web. Aidan cuts himself out of the web and fall to the floor. Chenris and Mordecai climb on to Drache's back and they all climb down together. 

Kal tries to belay down to the a lower branch. but hiss arrow breaks on impact resulting in him falling down. Mordecai loses his grip and falls down but chenris manages to keep his grip on Drache

The party packs up camp and goes to find the next page. As they are walking along the Chenris spots a deer that seems to smile at them.

They come to a now familiar looking derelict house. This time they give all of the pages to Steve and head in two groups as shows:
- Drache, Kal + Chenris 
- Aidan + Mordecai

House looks beautiful, and the child is still alive. Mordecai impersonates an elf and forces the father to do a survey for the [[Groups & Factions/Ye Old Tavern Down the Road\|Ye Old Tavern Down the Road]] to distract the family while Kale and Aidan infiltrate. Mordecai gets invited in for dinner while kale makes his life harder because of all the noise he is making. Suddenly, [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] attacks the area so eventually the household entrusts the page to Mordecai to keep it safe. 

(x:: The party escapes The Not World and heads east to the last page where they find the house and the not world. Inside the family is currently building the familiar house. The Dawn expanded their empire and the family moved from their house in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. They got here by being smuggled in with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Red Beard\|Captain Red Beard]]. )

(x:: Within the ship the Family had to make a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] to ensure their survival at the cost of their second-born The second-Born became [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]])

the party made their way to the clearing in [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]] to start [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]]. They approached the clearing as all light drained from the world, there was no time wasted as the party gathered wood for the fire that would eventually consume what they loved most. First came the pages. Whatever light that was left was snuffed out leaving the party in complete darkness. One by one, each party member offered their possessions up to the flame.

- Aidan threw in the key that he had used to escape the cult he had been holding since his birth. 
- (x:: Kal placed a worn out short sword offering it to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]] and stepped back, tears littering his face. )
- (x:: Mordecai was next, removing his [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|mother's]] cloak from his shoulders. With tears rolling down his face he tries to smell her one last time but her perfume faded with the years of campfire smoke. With a final goodbye, it his added to the fire.)
- Chenris quietly puts a hastily written note with an unsolved problem 
- (x:: Drache ripped [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] emblem from this shirt, kissing it and determined that he would find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|who went missing]].)


The first bell rang. as they kept their eyes shut, everyone was haunted by the ghosts of their past. 

- (x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]] called out for Kal's help, urging him to open his eyes and help her.)
- (x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]] whispered in his ears, tempting him to come home. She knew that he didn't mean to start the fire that consumed them.)
- (x:: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Chenris' teacher]] tempted him to open his eyes, telling him that chenris was his greatest achievement.)
- Drache's long lost forbidden love called out for him.

Yet no one opened their eyes

(x:: The final bell rang out as they opened their eyes,  [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] had been dispelled. Finally they were able to watch the father, that they had found to accidentally create it getting to hug his now not faceless son.)

The crew Made their Journey back to Two Pines to inform the council man that though they were unable to save his daughter, they did manage to defeat the thing that had taken her.  They travelled home to collect their rewards and to cement their status as true heroes of the land.

Everyone got super drunk.

Kal and Mordecai bonded over getting cool new capes.
