The party enter a room to find a bed a few levers, [[Kal †\|Kal †]] pulled one lever, felt a rumble then decided to say "fuck it" and pull them all; much to the party's dismay. Luckily all levers had to be down to open a set of 4 doors leading into a large cavern. 

In the cavern was a huge statue of a dwarvern king/lord separated from the group by a large ravine with a very rickety, old bridge. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] peered down into the darkness of the ravine and found out that there was a shit ton of explosives underneath the bridge. No one was surprised.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] hulks out and finds the perfect rock after [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] clearly was incapable of getting a lil pebble.  Mordecai throughs the pebble but it falls short and they find the bridge doesn't have a trigger for the explosives. The party nominates [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] to cross the bridge as he is the most dexterous; as soon as Aidan gets to the other side, the party hears the hissing of a fuse. Korrigan try's to convince the party to hide but Drache raises the excellent point of "fuck it" and they all run across the bridge. The explosives explode and the bridge falls into the abyss. Aidan wanted to steal the golden sword off of the statue but it was too big. 

There was two doors, a left door and a right door, the party goes down the right door to begin with. One of the corridors lead to Chenris' worst nightmare a library that's completely on fire and destroying all of the books in it. Chenris proceeds to have a mental break down over this. Moving along the party also finds a guards barracks, a food store where the food is slowly starting to spoil and the captains quarters. in which, the party finds a hidden entrance behind a bookshelves that leads the party back to the room with a bed in it. Chenris also managed to find the captains log detailing how the guards stationed here are trapped in by humans long ago. 

(x:: Korrigan breaks from the party to go to the room with the rations and bumps into a shadowy figure that he tries to befriend. It turns out that this figure has been living in the stronghold for a while to stay away from humans. He also warns not to get in [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] 's way. )

Meanwhile, The party are ears dropping on a group of goblins that are tripping to pillage the stronghold. They kept saying how they're were gonna be leaving soon because they found the "Great treasure" and that their boss was going to be very happy with them. Deciding that there were too many goblins for the party take on alone, the party snuck away to a different room. 

(x:: This room was a massive dinning room, with large ancient dwarven king and many animated skeleton who are all drinking and being merry. The party decide to take a long rest before engaging with this to make they're in a good condition to fight. That night, somehow both Chenris and Korrigan fall asleep and everyone wakes up to find there was one less research with them. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Corvus\|Corvus]], the mysteries figure from earlier reveals himself as a Corvum and is packing his bags to move out of the strong hold. When asked, he no idea where the other researcher went. )

The party go looking for the lost researcher and end up finding a small chapel, inside is the researcher on fire as well as a bible for [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]
