# Session Summary 
The session began quietly but uneasily within Leomund’s Tiny Hut, as the party attempted to recover from the previous night’s battle. Viktor, driven by morbid curiosity, enlisted Drache and a deeply reluctant Mordecai to haul zombie corpses inside for study. The task was as grim as expected, rancid bodies, mismatched limbs, and a great deal of nausea, but was made easier with Halfbie’s help via Tenser’s Floating Disk. During the effort, Mordecai narrowly avoided slipping on black ice by forcibly stabilising their magic, triggering a wild magic surge that cursed them with an overwhelming compulsion to eat gold coins before dawn or face a sense of impending doom. What followed was a deeply unsettling mix of coin-eating, awkward humour, and rising concern from the rest of the party.

Their unease deepened when one of the assembled corpses reanimated, muttering “Hunter” and reacting instinctively to heat. Viktor’s experiments revealed that warmth caused the creature to heal rapidly, confirming Halfbie’s suspicions that the hunters were afflicted by the same ancient curse as the elven cannibals—magic placed by a power far beyond mortal means. Viktor escalated matters by banishing both the zombie and Mordecai as part of an experiment, subjecting Mordecai to a timeless void and an unwanted, lingering embrace from the undead. When they returned, traumatised and screaming, Ringo abruptly ended the experiment by killing the zombie outright, admitting the party had grown dangerously complacent. That night, paranoia set in: strange “venison” meals, Hunter’s metal arrows, Viktor secretly cutting at the fused cloak in his flesh, and Halfbie warding the party’s gold to stop Mordecai from stealing it.

The session spiralled into the surreal as Mordecai, left alone and driven by hallucinations of Halfbie and Chenris, succumbed to their curse and devoured stolen gold before passing out. Dawn arrived violently, with purple lightning tearing apart the Tiny Hut as the Korrigan burst through a portal, mocking Mordecai before killing them outright, only for Viktor to resurrect them moments later. Shaken and sleepless, the party pressed on toward the Golden Fort. When Viktor attempted Divine Intercession for disguises, the call was answered not by a distant god, but by Vaelrith himself. Reapers slaughtered nearby pirates to provide clothing, and Vaelrith left Viktor with a chilling promise before cheerfully greeting Halfbie as “Father.” The session ended in stunned silence, Halfbie nervously joking as the horrifying implications settled in.

# Full Session Notes
(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cleared a space on the first floor inside their [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]] and tried to get comfortable. Their spell had made the area much warmer than the frigid, never-ending winter outside. From within, they watched as [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] called over the exhausted [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked him to help gather the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombies]]' corpses and bring them into the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], for further study. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began helping and even called [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] over to help them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was extremely hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to help.)

(x::With his helpers recruited, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] ventured into the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]] to take a break as they both watched the two struggle. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] crouched down to pick up the body, but as soon as they touched the body, they immediately recoiled. Rigour Mortis had well and truly set in to the body, and they stunk like someone hadn't washed ever, the same being true for the pelt they wore.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nearly vomited as they jumped back and out of the way. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], slowly becoming more confident with his magic casted Calm Emotions on the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]], and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] finally calmed down enough to slowly help [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] pull the bodies together. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] struggled to figure out which parts of the body matched with what, causing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to laugh and try to explain that the arm doesn't connect to the neck.)

(x::After a lot of back-and-forth, they had collected a [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]]. They began the arduous task of pulling the body towards the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took pity on the two. They quickly wrapped their coat tightly around themselves [^1] before poking out of the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]]. They summoned a Tenser's Floating Disk, which they could both more easily drag the corpses around.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried their best to help [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], but at somepoint the ice underfoot must have transformed into black ice, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slipped [^2]. They could feel their grip failing and their feet beginning to fly out from beneath them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], not wanting to look like an idiot, decided in that split second to try something they had used very often. Their magic is frequently chaotic, but after using it every day for so long, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had somewhat learnt to control the chaotic nature of their powers, as well as the world around them [^3].)

(x::This ability helped them avoid tripping. Still, the blowback from using the ability caused a wild magic surge. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], standing upright, suddenly gained two new feelings: the first was an insatiable need to consume [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. The second was an incredible sense of impending doom that happened if they didn't eat enough by dawn.)

(x::Without really thinking, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked if they could have a few [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. Thinking nothing of it, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] obliged. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is taking the coins and immediately eats them. If it weren't for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] maintaining direct eye contact with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] while doing so, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] probably wouldn't have questioned [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. However, they now stood stunned.)

(x::Before he could question [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] properly, Hlafbie leaned out of the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], coat still wrapped around them like a dressing gown. They yelled out, "Boyyyyysss, stop snacking, you'll ruin your dinner!")

(x::Looking up to the sky, they both realised how late it was getting, and a rumble from [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s stomach showed how hungry they were. They began walking back to the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]] when they started hearing a third set of footsteps. These steps were much heavier and sounded clumsy, each with a thud.)

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] turned around and too their shock, the corpse they had put back together had reanimated. It shuffled forward and growled more like an animal than a [[Other Information/Races/Human\|human]], "Hun- ter, Hun- ter")

(x::It shuffled closer, its hand slowly raised to point at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], its head cocked to one side almost mechanically as it tried to understand the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], from within the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], quickly noticed that the hunter was back on its feet. He rushed over to get a closer look; he was barely holding back his excitement as he inspected the body. With its frostbitten finger still pointing at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] grunted, "He-at")

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] shook his head, and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]]'s head moved to face [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], for his part, was muttering about how this one had been killed with [[Other Information/Unique Items/Hunter's Arrows\|Hunter's arrows]] and should probably be dead. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nodded, saying it's almost like it's defrosting.)

(x::Upon hearing this, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] for a lit torch to see what would happen. As soon as the fire began to burn, he watched the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] instantly start following it, first with its eyes, then as it lumbered towards it. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] held out the torch, and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] rushed over to grab it from his hand, then began rapidly warming its body. As it did, the cuts and wounds all started to heal.)

(x::From inside the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] watched the whole scene as they held their hands up to their face like looking through a frosted window. Aiden, who was sitting down near his bags, whittling some wood, was the only one to notice that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] was nowhere to be seen. When he finally pointed this out to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], worried for a sec that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] might have abandoned them, espailly has his pack and bow were missing. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly cast the spell [[Admin/Spells/Locate Object\|Locate object]], assuming that a seasoned hunter would never be caught without his bow. Their hunch was correct, as the bow was found relatively close by and wasn't moving further away from the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]].)

(x::While [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] continued observing, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took the opportunity to gather more [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was directed enough that he handed them over without thinking it through. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] began eating the coins like popcorn while they.)

(x::The group watch the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] slowly heal some of its wounds before taking the torch back. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] almost looked annoyed that someone had taken away its source of heat. pointing to itself and grunting "Co-ld" with a cheeky grin, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] waved, saying "Nice to meet you Co-ld, i'm [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who was suddenly watching from within, got a flash of memories from [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], and they began putting a few things together. These [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombies]] were not only under a similar curse as the evelen canibels, but the curse was placed upon them by the same powerful mage. This magic was so powerful that one would need a lot more magic than anyone could gather in their lifetime. Interestingly, the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] actually died during the fight, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] didn't study Magical Fauna enough to know why. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] passed on some o thier observation to [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], who began to wonder about the creature's nature.)

(x::He turned to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and asked if they would be ok with joining the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] in an experiment. After some convincing, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] eventually agreed, and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] began casting Banishment as soon as the spell was finished. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] suddenly blinked out of the material plane.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] thought they had their eyes open. It was strange; it was like the only thing that existed was the [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]]. They weren't surrounded by darkness, because that would still be something. They were surrounded by nothingness, but saying as much made the nothing into something which did not exist where they were right now.)

(x::With the source of heat from the torch, the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] enveloped [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] in a bearhug. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] smelled terrible as it would not let go. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] struggled for a while before eventually giving in. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] had explained that the spell would last 1 minute before they returned. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] waited... and waited... and waited. The thought that time might not exist where they were, but they pushed that away before they could start to panic. After either a minute or a millennium, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] blinked, and they were back in the freezing cold of [[Locations/Snowport\|snowport]].)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could not believe what was happening as their mind tried to process their experience in the void. They tried to make a witty remark, but all that came out was a single scream as their mind slowly unravelled. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] let go of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], also confused about what was happening. it stumbbled back and right into the sword of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]], who had snuck past everyone to land the killing blow. "Someone had to end it, and i'd didn't think it would be you lot")

(x::Everyone nodded; it was true they were having too much fun. They soon all returned to the tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] began building a fire to cook some food. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] also explained their sense of foreboding and their need to eat [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] donated some coins from the share account purse. When that wasn't enough, they melted down some more coins and turned them into a milkskae for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], who happily drank it down. This still wasn't enough, so [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] was called a 'Coin Shandy' by mixing some of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s beer with molten [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. This wasn't enough, and now [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was slightly drunk as it went immediately to their head. However, it did help with their panic attack.)

(x::After this, none of them were happy with the idea of using more of their [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s appetite didn't seem to [[Admin/Spells/Slow\|slow]] down. they didnt have much [[Other Information/Money\|money]] as it was. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] put a Glyph of Warding spell on the purse and explained that if [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to grab coins for it, then the bag would shoot them with a guiding bolt. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] put his purse under his mattress, which immediately became too scary to grab.)

(x::Aiden hid his bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] had none to speak of. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]]'s food was ready; it was more 'deer'. They all ate some meat. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took his meat basically raw, something [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] did without even being asked. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went in for seconds and soon found the meat almost addictive; [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] was glad to give him more food.)

(x::While the other slowly started getting ready for bed, when no one was looking, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took a small parry knife and began to cut back the cloth from his skin where the two had fused. He worked slowly as he methodically worked his way through. It was painful, and blood began to flow from the cut areas. He managed to cut a good amount before his experience told him that going further would be unsafe. Closing the wounds with his magic, he soon fell asleep more from exhusten then tiredness.)

(x::They soon all went to sleep, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was left alone, awake, surrounded by the one thing that made his sense of foreboding feel better.)

(x::Snooping around the area, they soon found the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] purse and took out a handful. In their delirious state, a minuture [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] appeared on their right shoulder and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] on the other. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] whispered in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s ear, "Go on you know you want to!")

(x::"Nooo! You can't do that; people expressly didn't want you to eat any more." said [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked at both, unsure of who they should believe. "Hmmm, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] i think you have to eat these coins," said [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], and after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked why, he said, "Well, if you die now, then you'll never be able to stick it to the man, you know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen]]")

(x::The Mini [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] let out an enormous exhale, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] thought for a moment before taking out a handful of coins and eating them all in one go. Mini [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] manage to interrupt [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s gorging of coins by asking [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], "Are you really going to listen and believe in [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]?")

(x::"Just becasue they dont like lisetrning to me doesnt mean hey know im not right." [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] retorted, "Besides they taste good, don't they [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]?")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s mind finally broke as they let out a confused laugh before essentially pouring the coins into their mouth and eventually passing out, covered in the stolen [[Other Information/Money\|money]].)

(x::Everyone was suddenly ok in the morning when purple lightning crashed into Leomund's Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], smashing through and destroying the spell. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was on his feet, greatsword already drawn and ready. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] already had their spell book at the ready, and Aiden had their knives drawn and ready. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slowly blinked awake as he registered what was happening. They got up, and where the lightning had landed was a magenta portal.)

(x::With a chorus of manic laughter, [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/The Korrigan (Herald)\|The Korrigan (Herald)]] step out of the portal. His blackened fur swayed in the bone-chilling wind. His cranned his neck to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. "Times up, boy, looks like you could stuff enough coins in you," he growled.)

(x::Before anyone could react, another bolt of purple lightning zapped from the [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]]'s hand, striking [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] square in the chest and leaving them dead on the spot. The korrigan joined his ensemble in a fit of crazed laughter and returned to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|feywild]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] rushed to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s side and healed them back to health.)

(x::With none being able to sleep again, they continued on. They crunched through the snow in silence, and the sun crested the horizon. They walked along the shore, still hidden behind the treeline. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] broke the silence by asking if they had a more solid plan, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] said that they would need to get closer to the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]] to see what their options were. As they carried on, the fort came into view on the horizon, and two fleet members were seen walking along the sea bank towards their base.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] mentioned it might be easier if they all had disguises, to which [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] began casting Divine intercession, expecting it to fail like usual. Suddenly, a dark and silky voice rang out in [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]'s head. "What do you want alive one?")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] panicked upon hearing the voice and shouted that he wished to enter the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]]. As soon as he spoke, two reapers emerged from the ground, near the two pirates walking along the beach. One of them was instantly recognised as [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]. The toll of a bell rang out across the beach, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] watched in horror as the souls of the pirates were harvested by the reapers, causing their bodies to vanish and leaving only their clothes behind.)

(x::More reapers appeared, carrying additional sets of clothes and dumping them onto a pile. Everyone except [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] left, as he floated in the air above the heap of garments. He turned to [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] and, in that same dark and silky voice, said, "I will come for you soon." His words echoed as if he were standing right next to them, despite being several hundred meters down the coast. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]'s already pale skin seemed to go even whiter as he struggled to process what was happening.)

(x::[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] then turned to look at [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and, with a much more pleasant voice, waved and said, "Hi Father!")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] waved back, "Hi... Son...?")

(x::[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] soon vanished, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] we left in stunned silence. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave a nervous laugh, "They grow up so fast...")

# Trivia

- [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] did not leave the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]] throughout this session because if they did, the spell would end, and they would have to cast it again. The spell also specifies that the user cannot cast magic from within the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]] to outside of it, which is why they did not intervene further.
- The D1000 magic table, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had been using for wild magic surges, seems not work anymore, so we no longer moved to this [D10,000 table](https://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf)
- Moredcai's wild magic surge required them to consume 3lbs of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins or take d100 damage at dawn.
- [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] sleeping on his [[Other Information/Money\|money]] led to him having the best sleep ever in this session, as he had become a dragon(born) sleeping on his hoard. He now does this constantly
