# Session Summary 
The Party travels to the Golden Fort, investigating a strange snow mound and dealing with wild magic mishaps before sneaking into the hunters’ entrance. Inside, they bluff their way past staff, gather information, and Halfbie expertly manipulates a clerk to obtain a list of high‑ranking officers and access to the fort's layout. Their cover remains precarious, but they press deeper into the fort’s organised and surprisingly bureaucratic environment.

They attempt to gain access to the armoury but are turned away without proper documentation, eventually returning after tricking the guards into leaving. Inside, they encounter a mysterious hooded figure with golden eyes, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]], who sees through their intentions. She warns them of the overwhelming power of the Golden Fleet, questions their motives, and challenges the viability of their plan while still showing a subtle interest in their courage.

Despite Viktor’s hostility, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] refuses to fight them and instead offers hospitality and neutrality as long as they do not destroy the armoury. With Halfbie heading off to keep their "date" and the rest of the Party following [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] to her luxurious quarters, the group regroups, unsure whether their mission should continue as planned or be abandoned in light of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]]’s warnings.

### Session Notes
(x::It was beginning to get dark as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] stood in relative silence after [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]'s 'help'. From the slight hill where they stood, they could clearly see not only the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]] but also the small hunting entrance, partially obscured by a large mound of snow. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was the first to break the silence, suggesting they start making their way to the fort to investigate the best ways forward.)

(x::Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if there was any plan beyond going in guns blazing. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was quick to point out that with their new outfits, they could easily blend in and presumably walk straight into the fort. "Do they have a front door we can use?" he asked.)

(x::"They do, but it's at the front and primarily for ships to enter and leave the fort", [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained.)

(x::Vikotr quickly agreed that using that entrance wouldn't be the best; using the hunter's entrance would probably be their best option. using their hands to shield their eyes, they repeated the assault from the snowstorm. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] couldn't quite understand what they were seeing; the large snow mound seemed to be... breathing. Completely forgetting the reason for their mission here instantly became interested in the anomaly.)
(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] promptly exited the conversation and began rushing down to the breathing snow. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly noticed [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s absence and, with a cry of frusttion encouraged the rest to follow. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stopped some 20 feet from the snow and declared that someone more sturdy should be sent to investigate. All eyes fell on [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], who, after futile protest, gave in and approched the the snow.)

(x::In the meantime, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] offered to cast mage armour on anyone around, since most weren't wearing their regular armour. Casting it on themselves, the spell enveloped their body with protective energy. however [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] soon felt the telltale sign of a wild magic search and instantly began searching around to see what had happened.)
(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned around, and to the group's [[Admin/Spells/Alarm\|alarm]], their mouth was now missing. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was completely unable to speak. Once over the initial shock of the sight, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] half-joked that they quite enjoyed silence that came along with the surge, but quickly withdrew the comment when [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], now communicating via a Ye olde pub down the road, head notepad, explained that wthout the their mouth they would be unable to cast any spells, including [[Admin/Spells/Pass without Trace\|Pass Without Trace]].)

(x::Meanwhile [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went closer to the pile of snow and strangely felt a familial bond with the pile. This fact was made even weirder when he tentatively brushed some snow away to reveal a large copper plate. Drach's mind flashed with images of dragons and other such monsters with metallic skin.)

(x::He quickly returned to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], which was gathering around a mouthless [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]. Upon hearing draches acount, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s passion was reignited. They explained to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that if they cast another spell, but allowed the magic surge to go through, then it would cancel out the current effect.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took half an acid and cast [[Admin/Spells/Enhance Ability\|enhance ability]] on the wizard, giving them an enhanced level of charisma. However, in return, their body broke out in what looked like the suckers on an octopus had left marks all over their body like a hickey. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] gave an awkward laugh when they both returned to a confused party and explained that it would help them blend in a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] with the pirates. With [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] now desperately trying not to laugh, they continued their investigation into the strange snow mound.)
(x::After a short but thorough investigation, including many pokes with a stick, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was able to determine that this was some chilling unit that nobles would use to keep their food cold and preseve for longer. However, they had no idea why the machine was here espeially when it was so cold outside. Some in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] were tempted to switch off the machine to see what would happen, in case it was being used for some other purpose. However, the idea was quickly dismissed when it was pointed out that this could alert the fort to their presence.)

(x::They soon found the door into the fort, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast [[Admin/Spells/Pass without Trace\|Pass Without Trace]] to give them better luck in blending in. Inside was a large entrance hall that the hunters used as a central point and meeting area before hunts. It was clearly regularly used, with many wet footprints visible tracing the common paths through the area. There were many coats hung up, trying to cover what seemed to be an office or desk. Notably, there were many more coats than footprints. Aiden took the chance to go through the coats and found 10 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggests they wait to see if anyone stops by, so [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] can follow them or get more information on key [[Locations/Locations\|locations]] in the fort. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] waited in the reception room for about 10 minutes before an older person walked down some nearby stairs and took a seat at the desk. He quickly excused his absence and asked how he could help them. Moredcai explained that they were recruits and had no idea what to do after returning from a recent hunt.)

(x::The old man gave a kind smile before opening his ledger and asking if they knew who their supervisors were. Once hearing this, they didn't know this information either, and he started listing names, putting considerable emphasis on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra Goldmark]], who, they presumed from his tone, was of a higher station than the rest.)

(x::Finally, the man said he would write them in for now, but they really needed to learn the names of at least the important people in the fort. He then asked for their ID cards so he could register them properly. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they had lost their way after being attacked by a [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] in the forest. The man let out a sigh before commenting that this happened all too frequently and that he would talk to leadership about getting rid of the physical ID system once and for all.)

(x::He then handed them a sheet and a new card and asked them to sign themselves in. Seeing the dotted line immediately reminded them of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s history of accidentally signing magical contracts [^1]. Mordecasi quickly grabbed the papers, signed each with a fake name, and handed them back, acting as if they had helped the man. The old man chuckled and thanked them for their help.)

(x::He then suggested that they go out into the fort's main area and report to someone in the main office who could provide more concrete information on what to do next. The group thanked the man for his kindness and opened the large double doors into the fort. evening with it being well into the eveening the fort was bustling with noise and pirates rushing to do their duties. Many carried books and clipboards and followed what seemed ot be one-way systems on certain streets.)

(x::Catching a glimpse at some of the documents many carried as they followed the general flow to a building near the centre of the fort. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] noticed that many of the documents were ship manifests, schedules, and rotas, prompting them to ask why a group of pirates would need, let alone use, organisational tools and bureaucracy.)

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned with a gleam in their eyes, "I'm so happy that you asked!" they beamed. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began explaining that any operation of this size would need a paper trail to ensure everything worked as intended, especially since the pirate's code demanded that every crewmate receive an equal share of the loot, with the captain receiving a larger share to keep the operation running. If there were no such documentation, then how would anyone know what the intake and outtake were, or which supplies the ships would need to carry out their raids?)

(x::Many of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] had zoned out by the end of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s explanation, instead focusing on the large hall in front of them. Many of the forts' buildings have [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] furnishings and decorations; however, this hall seemed to be even more ornate. The front entrance had a long line stretching out in front of it, so [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] joined it to blend in further.)

(x::Getting to the front of the queue, they were called over by a clerk. "How can i help?" the young Clerk asked, his patience clearly wearing thin.)

(x::"We're here for the meeting?" [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked plainly.)

(x::"Which meeting?" the Clerk replied curtly.)

(x::"With the commander?" said [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].)

(x::"The meeting with our commander, I do not have forever boy", sneered [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]].)

(x::"Isn't that your job?" sneered [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], quickly catching on to [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]'s plan, "You know, to tell us where to go for our meeting?")

(x::Before the clearly announced Clerk could respond, "Excuss me boys," [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said as they pushed through the two. They flourished their hand on the desk and, with a confident smile, said, "Has anyone told you how semetrical your face is?")

(x::Everyone, including the Clerk, was dumb founded into silence. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] secretly passed a note back to Vikotr that read 'Good guard, bad guard'. And with a wink, they turned back to the Clerk had gone ruby red at such an unexpected remark [^2]. "O- oh-i've never been called symmetrical before..." their once stern voice now shaky with nerves. Leaning over the desk, to get closer, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if the Clerk knew where they needed to go, as they were new to the fort.)

(x::"Yeah, I'll happily send... You can also chat with me for however long you want. In fact, you don't even need to go to your meeting with your commander if you don't want to; I mean, you can stay here and talk to me.")

(x::The others were dumb founded that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s plan worked. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked the Clerk for a list of commanders, so they could find them on their own while they spent some time with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. The Clerk handed over a list without even thinking, before asking [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], " So... do you wanna grab some coffee, it's this new thing we found in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]].)

(x::"With someone with a wrinkly brain, such as yourself, I'd rather grab a nice bottle of wine,, replied [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] with a voice like butter.)

(x::"Well.. 'em, we're not allowed to have alchole in the fort...")

(x::"Surely you have some hidden away for... special occasions?)

(x::The Clerk looked around before saying, " well i do have an old bottle back at my place if you wanted to join me tonight...")

(x::"it's a date!" [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaimed before writing down the magical sigil for their crystal communications device. and handed it over with a wink.)

(x::"I dont know what this is but thank you", they held the paper with both hands and gave a bashful smile.)

(x::Hafbie turned on their heel and began walking away, giving their best salute as they did, leaving not just the clerks but also [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s jaw on the floor.)

(x::"Hate to see the go, but love to watch the leave." the Clerk mumbled before trying their best return to their work.)

(x::The group soon caught up with the boy, where [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] exclaimed that there was nothing left for them to teach [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::"i dont knowhow you did it but, but youre way better than me!" said [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] with a proud smile.)

(x::"Yeah i dont know what he meant by going over for more than just wine, id prefer just the wine but ateast we got the names and where their offices are")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] patted them on the back and gave them one of the only books they owned. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] instantly recognised it as a popular fanfiction/ smut book that had recently become popular in a book shop called 'AO3')

(x::Finding a very basic map, they spotted that nearby was an armoury, something Aiden said might be a good target to sabotage to make the raid go more smoothly. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] all agreed, and they began making their way there. Along the way, the group got a [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] on the crystal from  [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], who said:)

(x::Dear [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Fatebreakers]] and Mx Reverence,
 
Re: [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s invasion of The [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]]

 I assume all is well.
 
Another idea is we could poison the water source for the fort. We have access to a powerful poison; we need to find that source.

Your sincerly,

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] also shared that he had the spell contagion that they could use to do the same thing. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] were against the idea since it would kill indiscriminately, and they wanted to give the fort a chance to surrender. While this was happeneing [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] looked around, and his eyes fell upon a shadowy figure standing atop a roof. It was a struggle to make out any details of the figure apart from the fact that they had glowing golden eyes. The figure quickly saw they had been spotted, turned around and disappeared behind the roof.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] immediately alerted [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], and they began moving quickly toward the armoury, aware that their cover might be blown. They soon found the armour, which was a huge warehouse that towered above the nearby buildings. Inside, there were a few pirates, each gathered around a desk with a large, gruff man sitting behind it. All of them had instinctively reached for their weapons as the door opened.)

(x::Notably, on all of their armour, there is a logo of a man resting on a cannon. The armour itself was of quite good quality, and as the men stood up and greeted them with gruff voices. The clerks in the back barely even looked up from their paperwork.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] only walked up and stated that they were here to pick up an order for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]].)

(x::"Where's your permission form, i aint relaseasing anything without the right form." growled the man.)

(x::"Are you sure you wanna piss off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] more than they already are?" bluffed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].)

(x:: "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] can lick my boot, I answer to Rick no'ne else." he man barked "If we're gonna have a problem hear i sugest you bring the form or bring [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] herself, without those, you'll get nothing")

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] eventually gave up and decided it would be best to try to make a forgery or sneak in when everyone had gone to bed. Leaving the building, they found the streets much quieter, and most people still didn't have a clipboard or any papers.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked how attached [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was to their new 'friend', to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] repleied that it would be rude not to turn up to the plan they had made not an hour ago. That's when they all noticed that the guards from the armoury were now also leaving and were currently in the process of locking up. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] walked over and told the guards that their boss was ina n emmergancy eeting and that they all had to be there as well. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] offered to finish locking up and drop the key around in the morning so the guard could leave for their meeting immediately. The guard's eyes narrowed on the small [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] before begrudgingly agreeing.)

(x::When the guard was out of sight, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] opened the doors and went inside. They quickly found the security door to the main warehouse and opened that as well. Inside the room, it was completely dark except for a window on the roof that let in a single [[Admin/Spells/Moonbeam\|moonbeam]], flooding the centre of the room with a pale, ghostly white. standing oin the middle of that light was the hooded figure with golden eyes.)

(x::She took off her hood and called out to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] beckoniing them to take a seat with her and gesturing to the circle of chairs around her before taking a seat herself. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was the first to walk up and join her, before the rest walked up as well.)

(x::Sitting down, she broke the awkward silence by asking, "So you want to steal some of our [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] huh?")

(x::"Steal? More like redistribute,, replied [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] coyly)

(x::"I wouldn't recommend it", she replied, "you're up aganst a force you cannot win agaist")

(x::Her words began making many of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], except [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], start to really doubt the plan. As far as any of them could tell, she wasn't doing this maliciously; she seemed quite worried about [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] and their survival.)

(x::"Why are you here? for ome [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]? What do you want out of this?" she asked.)

(x::"So were running an action at the moment", said [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], unsure of how much to say. " and we kind of need some [[Other Information/Money\|money]] to do that...")

(x::"We'd be killing two birds with one stone. We get [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] and free travel on the seas." [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] interjected)

(x::"I am well aware of this... Does it look like you'll be able to get rid of us anytime soon?")

(x::"What about a trade deal then?" asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]])

(x::"Ive got [[Other Information/Money\|money]], ive got power, ive got freedom, what more could you offer me?")

(x::"How about entertainment?" asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]])

(x::"Oh, we have plenty of that here. mainly from torturing people up and down the coastline." She said with a knowing smile, "It's funny, when you let people be savages outside, they become incredibly good workers inside.")

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had no response. The women kept talking and asked where they thought all the [[Other Information/Money\|money]] in the banks of the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|verdant peninsula]] came from. She explained that most of their [[Other Information/Money\|money]] came from owning those banks, in some way or another. Is why there is such a common current, though the land, because the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]] is holding the whole thing up.)

(x::"Now the way I see it, we have two ways forward: you could kill me here and contiune you plan before ultimatley dying, or you could leave and live on to steal from other nations")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had spent most of their time analysing the women's eyes, and from what they could tell, it was a rare magical consideration that allowed the owner to see through anything to see someone's true intentions. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] had also been thinking and was certain that his person, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]], didn't have much combat power, but she was clearly incredibly charming.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was the first to break the silence by turning to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] and explaining that they were unsure about the plan. And how it seemed like a huge risk that didnt see m worth it anymore, now they had been found out.)

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] smiled and nodded in agreement. She even offered to host [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] at her house since the snowstorm was so powerful.)

(x::"Say that we killed you now and get it over with", stated [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] coldly as he began channelling nerctoic energy, " how mch [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] is you life worh to you?")

(x::"My life is woh nothing, i was nothing before [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]], and ill be nothing after the fleet. I am nothing but a cog in a very large machine", she replied just as coldly.)

(x::"If you're nothing but a cog in a machine..." [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] said, learning from the voice serious, "Why don't you join the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]?")

(x::Asta almost laughed atthe notion, "Are you kidding me? Have you seen what it's like outside?? Murder, killing, god;s running rampant, another underlying on the borders - im not sure if wanna leave this place")

(x::"I don't think you'll be nay safe beind these walls or ours if Ignatious returns", replied [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]].)

(x::"Yes, but i atelast want to die in a place that's oranised, slighty safer and wherei call the shots")

(x::"You can have that with us as well")

(x::"Didn't you recently have a cult appear, as well as a rebellion?")

(x::"There have always been cults in this world, but have you ever had one dedicated to you? Have you ever had fanatic loyalty? ")

(x::"...Not sold unfortunately. We have many soliders willing to lay down their lives for this place")

(x::"You don't know it yet, but you become a part of something even bigger than the fort if you join us")

(x::Astras unyielding calm wavered for a moment before their smile returned. They weren't interested in joining the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] as of yet, but they wanted to see how far [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] could go, so she said that if they did not explode the armoury, she would not interfere with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] and would even keep the office to allow them to sleep in her home for the night.)

(x::She then turned to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], as said, "I believe you have some prior arrangement to get to, the rest can follow me to my place.")

(x::"That's true. Do you know how to get to room 1312?")

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] began to give direction to the house not too far from the armoury before beckoning the other to join her. She took them to a large increaibly ornate building. Inside, which was filled with many plush sofas, cushions, and golden statues, she guided them to their own individual room and showed them where to find the facilities. "I hope you enjoy your stay at the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]]", she said coyly before leaving for her own room.)
