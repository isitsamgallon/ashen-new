# Session Information
**Session Date:** 28th Nov 2025 
**Saga**: 7th Saga - Winter Warriors
**Attendance**: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]],[[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Jae Knight\|Jae Knight]]

# Session Summary 
The session began with the party making their final preparations in Blackwall before setting off for Snowport. While Viktor gathered supplies, Halfbie attempted—disastrously and triumphantly—to teach Drache “Go Fish,” accidentally summoning an actual interdimensional fish through repeated, table-shattering slams of an unopened deck. After recovering from the chaos, the group reunited with their old sailor contact, Lil Boat Boy, who agreed to ferry them north. Snowport proved isolated, snowy, and expensive; Halfbie’s attempt to buy a _Silence_ scroll spiralled into farce when Mordecai, flustered, claimed Halfbie was “mentally challenged” to justify haggling. The shopkeeper refused to sell them powerful magic, offering instead a fake training scroll and demanding that the pair hunt him two deer before earning a real discount.

As Halfbie and Mordecai investigated the woods behind the shop, they spotted a figure lurking in the blizzard—just as Viktor, elsewhere in town, found himself trapped in a quietly horrifying encounter. While offering healing services door-to-door, Viktor entered a house inhabited by a kindly old man who believed the skeletal remains of his wife and daughter were still alive. Strange scratches formed in the walls, a pale ghostly girl appeared briefly, and Viktor was locked in a supernatural room before reviving the man from a sudden heart attack. Only by waiving his fee for the ghosts did Viktor stop the entity’s attacks. He fled the house at once, casting _Death Ward_ on the oblivious man before sprinting to find Drache, who had meanwhile been negotiating with a former Golden Fleet pirate—now a hunter demanding 20% of the Golden Fort’s eventual loot in exchange for guiding them safely through the deadly northern woods.

Back at the edge of the forest, the threat Halfbie sensed proved very real. Snowballs packed with stones crashed around them before two camouflaged attackers seized Halfbie with a bag over the head and stalked Mordecai from behind. Halfbie’s magical fire erupted in a devastating blast, injuring both ambushers; Mordecai followed with precision spells, and the pair fought in brutal tandem. Their foes fell—only to rise moments later in eerie silence before fleeing with a third figure into the storm. With the forest hiding enemies who would not stay dead and Snowport clearly stranger than it first appeared, Halfbie summed up the party’s mood with a dry, victorious grin: “Snowport is going to be fun.” Mordecai could only mutter, exhausted, “Shut up.”

# Full Session Notes
(x::With most of their preparations made, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] found [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] and Aidan and walked them through the plans as they walked through [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to make any last-minute purchases. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] bought themselves a winter coat so they wouldn't freeze in the northern climate. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] mentioned he needed to pick up some ingredients for medicines and potions and told the rest to wait for him in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the black tower]].)

(x::While waiting, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] attempted to teach [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] how to play 'Go Fish'. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't help but watch with a smirk, having played the game many times. Without opening the pack of cards, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] hoisted them high into the air before slamming them down on the table as hard as they could, all while shouting "GO FISH" as loud as they could. Before clearing their throat, saying, "Somethin' like that. You know you've won when an anthropomorphic fish shows up out of a portal.")

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nodded, his head in fake understanding, and without hesitation, the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] slammed his hand atop [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s and the unopened deck of cards. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] did their best to hide the white pain of a fractured wrist under the scaled hands of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. The table they were playing their 'game' on lacked such an ability and was visibly cracked and damaged. With a swish of their other hand, healing magic enveloped their hand and fixed their wrist.)

(x::After rolling up their sleeves, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was about to go again. Before they could, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] interjected, asking, "Would you not have better luck if you took the cards out of the pack?")

(x::[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] genuinely looked dumbfounded at the notion, "What th- how would that even work? You can open a pack of cards!?!?")

(x::Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could retort, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had already hoisted the pack into the air and slammed it onto the table, cracking it even further, but still in one piece. When there was no responce from the anthropomorphic fish, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] picked up the cards. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a quick moment to fix the table before [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] followed the motions of their 'game', and silence filled the room before another 'Go Fish!!' rang out through the room.)

(x::After a brief pause, a bright blue portal opened in the middle of the room. From the portal emerged an anthropomorphic fish who, in a high-pitched scream, said, "STOP CALLING ME, I DON'T CARE!!" before quickly returning to wherever they came from. The room was silent for a few long minutes; everyone, except a very proud [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], were shocked into silence, their jaws hanging comically open.)

(x::The silence was only broken when [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] returned, opening the door to the scene that had just happened. None of them were able even to begin explaining what happened, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was too busy celebrating their win. Once the shock had worn off somewhat, they walked down to the Blackall Docks and were confronted by a bustling shipyard filled with boats, unloading, loading and travelling through the port.)

(x::Using their hand to block the sun's rays, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] surveyed the scene before coming across a familiar face, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lil Boat Boy\|Lil Boat Boy]], the sailor who took them to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]][^1]. After pointing the man out, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] went over to say hi, and after a brief exchange and many introductions, the sailor agreed to take them to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]].)

(x::[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it would be best for them to take the regular trading routes, although they didn't have a ship to protect them. By sticking close to the office, the [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant guild]] vessels could still allow them to benefit from their protection, scaring off any members of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]].)

(x::They soon touched down in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]], a relatively small town with only a few general stores, a [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]], and a tavern or two to break up the monotony of the dilapidated houses. While [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] checked out the Tavern to see if they had any rooms available $_{and to see what Ales they had}$, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|mordecai]] ventured into the [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was hoping to pick up a Spell Scroll of Silence.)

(x::With [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] so cut off from the rest of the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]], all prices were much higher than [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had expected. They tried to bargain with the shopkeeper, but the Halfing stood steadfast in his pricing. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly called after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to see if they could work their magic. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], unusually flustered from being put on the spot, said that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was mentally challenged, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was their career. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had been tasked with getting the scroll to help build their confidence.)

(x::The shopkeeper became very concerned that selling a spell scroll to someone with issues could cause a lot of danger for not just [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] but the wider community. After some pleading, the shopkeeper made a fake scroll and gave it to [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] to simulate completing their objective. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used [[Admin/Spells/Message\|Message]] to apologise to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and promised to make it right. Eventually, they agreed that if the two of them managed to hunt and give the keeper two deer from the woods behind the shop, he would give them a 50% discount on a real scroll.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]], not intending to go hunting just as night was beginning to fall and the snow thickened, decided it might be a good idea for them to have a look at the forest before joining the others. Try as they ight, their gazes could not penetrate the thick veil of the snow; they soon gave up and turned to the Tavern. However, they were about to complete their turn, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] saw it.)

(x::Out of the corner of their eye, they spotted a figure moving through the forest and disappeared behind a tree. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] froze, their head whipping back to where the figure disappeared. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to tug at the sleeves of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s fur coat, urging them to ignore it and carry on.)

(x::### Viktors POV)
(x::While the others were out doing a shop, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] decided it was a great chance to make some [[Other Information/Money\|money]] by knocking on doors to see if anyone needed healing for a fee. Picking a random door, he rapped his knuckles against the weak and frayed wood and waited for an answer. The door soon swung open to reveal an older-looking man who greeted him with a rare smile.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] made his pitch to the gentlemen, explaining that he was a healer looking to make a little [[Other Information/Money\|money]] and was going around offering healing for a reasonable price. The man's face instantly brightened up as he explained that although he was in no need of some healing, his wife and daughter were having some trouble, and it would be great if [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] could do a check-up on them. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] happily agreed and was invited inside.)

(x::Once the door was shut, the old man shouted for his daughter and wife to join him and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] in the kitchen, but as the two entered, he was taken aback to find his daughter already there. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] became incredibly confused when he surveyed the kitchen; there was no one in it but the two of them. When he pointed this out to the man, they both had bewildered faces, mirroring each other, as the man pointed to one of the chairs at the table and insisted that his daughter sat there.)

(x::Upon getting closer, he found that the chair was surrounded by a pile of humanoid bones, as if something had sat there when it died; over time, as it decomposed, the bones had fallen to the floor. While looking, the old man asked his daughter to explain what was wrong with her, then paused before turning to the doctor and asking what he thought.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was taken about by the circumstances he found himself in as he watched the man have a whole one-sided conversation with the air around the chair, surrounded by bones. Instead of addressing the daughter, he offered to speak with the wife before giving his conclusion. The man nodded before calling to his wife in the next room, asking if she wanted a cup of tea. After a brief pause, she shouted back, 'OK!' before offering a drink to the doctor.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] declined the offer as he followed the man into the living room, where the man gestured to the armchair that had once looked comfortable but was now quite dilapidated. Similar to the chair in the kitchen, this one also had a pile of bones sitting in the middle. "Tell this kind young man why you're not feeling 100%. The silence of the skeleton's response was much longer than the one found in the kitchen, so [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took the time to activate his eyes of the grave ability and found that although the bones themselves were not soaked in undead energy, the whole house had a kind of dark miasma filling its walls.)

(x::When it felt like the wife was done talking, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked if he could have a look around the house to 'confirm his suspicions'. The man allowed it, and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took a look through the house, finding the same miasma in each room. As he walked through the doorway of one of the rooms, the door slammed shut behind him. For a moment, out of the corner of his eyes, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] spotted a younger-looking girl outside the window, her complexion deathly pale, and she panicked, pointing behind him. However, when he tried to turn his head for a better view, no one was there. He caustiously opened the door and found the other man fallen to the floor, where he lay motionless, clutching his chest.)

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] rushed over to check his pulse, making the grim discovery that the man had died. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] cast [[Admin/Spells/Revivify\|Revivify]] on the man and watched as the once corpse gasped loudly for breath. He helped the grateful man sit up. "Thank you, thank you, young one", he spluttered.)

(x::With an uncharitable smile, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] said, "No problem, that'll be 50 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]", he said, revealing an outstretched hand for the payment.)

(x::"Ah, yes, is your purpose that makes sense, my [[Other Information/Money\|money]] is in the safe upstairs, follow me", the bewildered man replied.)

(x::They both trudged up the stairs into what was presumably the man's bedroom, where [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] watched the man open a safe hidden in the wardrobe. He opened the door to reveal a large pile of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. Looking back at the [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], he asked, "50 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] was it?")

(x::[[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] instantly replied, "500 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]," as sure as he could. But before he could continue his white lie, a large scratch was clawed into the wall he stood next to- the threat was clear.)

(x::"Sorry, what was that?" the man responded, holding and hand to his ear, "In my old age, I struggle to hear sometimes.")

(x::"50 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]", [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] correct with an easy look at the nearly formed scratch. With that, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], desperate to leave the house as the scratches continued their relentless march across the walls towards his neck.)

(x::"Thank you, young man. How much do I owe you for my wife and daughter?" asked the old man, seemingly unaware of the large gashes ripped through his walls.)

(x::"Oh that's no problem, I didn't do much, it's on the house", he spluttered. To his relief, he deep gashes stopped in their tracks upon hearing that the treatment was free.)

(x::"Ah, what a nice young man you are, " the old man beamed, still unaware of the deep supernatural damage done to his walls. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] briskly walked out the front door, waving goodbye to the piles of bones, and walked over the threshold. The man happily came to the door, passing on his wife's thanks for his help. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] said that it was no trouble at all. Before he left, he looked the man up and down and cast Death ward on the man.)

(x::Victor then walked away as fast as he could without looking like he was running. Only when he heard the creaky old wooden door click shut behind him did he begin to run to the Tavern to find [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].)

(x::### Drache's POV)

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] entered the door and breathed in the smell of charcoal, Ale, and hearty food. The familiar smells finally relaxed him after a long day. Sitting at the bar, he ordered a local ale and enjoyed the bar snacks. Sitting there, he wondered if there was anyone who could help him and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] navigate their way around the area. Looking at the rest of the Tavern, many of the people there were clearly identifiable as sailors and hunters. While waiting for the other, he decided to ask around and see if anyone could help them.)

(x::Approaching one of the hunters, he asked if they could tell him about navigating through the forests around [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]] explained that if you wanted to travel, there were two options: walk along the coast and risk being robbed by [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]], or walk through the forest. However, without a knowledgeable guide, they wouldn't last more than a day before they got lost and died, or were 'attacked by the...wildlife')

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked how much [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] it cost to hire a hunter to take them through the woods. The man looked around him before saying, "Whereabouts are you going?")

(x::"Just sorta getting a rough idea of how much it will cost first")

(x::"You understand how dangerous it is to have a hunter who does not know the destination they are heading to, right?")

(x::"Yeah, I wouldn't expect you to sign up without knowing, I just wanted a rough estimate")

(x::"I tell you what, lad, I'll do it for around 1000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], maybe more, depending on where you're going")

(x::"That might be a bit much, we're still searching for fortune at the moment, although if successful, that would be doable.")

(x::The hnter called to the bartender, asking for a private room to talk for a moment. The man behind the bar nodded to a small side room they could use. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]] beckoned him inside, holding the door open for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. Once inside, with the door closed, the hunter drew a dagger, pointing it at the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]].)

(x::"Now we are you going?" he said threateningly.)

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], not particularly phased by such a small blade, replied, "What a way to ask")

(x::"Where are you going? I'll help, I need to know it's worth it")

(x::"Yeah, I would expect you to agree without knowing, but we can't afford to pay 1000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] right now.")

(x::"im not saying 1000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. you said you treasure hunting right? I want out of here, so ill ask again where are you going?")

(x::"The [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]]", [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] said matter-of-factly.)

(x::[[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]]'s knife wavered for a second. The shock proved too great as he slammed the knife on a table and sat with his head in his hands for a moment.)

(x::"So you're taking on the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]] then?" the hunter said, head still in hands.)

(x::"Yes, we have to take the walls first, and if we come out on top, then we're richer than nations. I know it sounds ridiculous, so I still don't expect you to help us.)

(x::"I should come clean, I used to be a pirate with them, and I might be able to help even better.)

(x::"So you know them well?")

(x::"Well, I've not been there in a while, but yes, I do. I want 20% of the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. I won't fight with you, but I'll guide you through the woods." Said the hunter, making his plea. " we're talking millions of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] here, not fucking chump change")

(x::"what could one man spend all of that [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] on?")

(x::"Let's make it obvious, you need me, or you're dead meat. I wager the odds of you dying in the forest, getting killed on a beach 150. With me, you at least get there.")

(x::"That I hate to say it, but you may be right. But this isn't a decision I can make alone. You can meet the rest of my Party. Make your case, and we'll see then. How about that?")

(x::"Fine... and sorry for threatening you with a knife")

(x::[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s laugh was cut short by a faint, low rumbling, and the panicked sounds of [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] burst into the main Tavern. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] turned to the hunter, who said, "Meet me here in an hour with the rest of your party and then we'll talk")

(x::As soon as [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] saw [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]], he ran over, raving about a haunted house. It took [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quite some time ot calm down his friend and get the whole story.)

(x::Mordecai & Halfbie's POV:)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tugged at [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s sleeve again, but knew it would do nothing to convince the boy to give up on something that had piqued their interest. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], tracing [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s gaze into the woods and then back to the boy, stated, "We need muscle and maybe someone who knows what theyre doing")

(x::Pulling up their sleeves shows off their somewhat thin but strangely toned arms, and they are proud of their own muscles, hitting several bodybuilding poses. After a pitiful look from [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], they got serious for a moment and pointed a finger towards the sky, and a tiny [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] appeared. The [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] illuminated the area around them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to retort before the [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] warped into a ball of lightning, then into a ball of wind and then into a green, poisonous sludge ball. "I dont need a sword or axe to defend myself, nor do you")

(x::Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|mordecai]] could respond, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned to the woods again and shouted, "is anybody there?!!")

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] cut them off, shushing them harshly. "You're going to get us killed!!")

(x::Before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], good, a snowball flew past both of them and hit a tree with shocking force. Spying the rock hidden within the snowball, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shouted back, "That's not how you have as snowball fight!!" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] immediately took cover behind a tree. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|Minor Illusion]] to create a wall of snow they could hide behind, then, using [[Admin/Spells/Shape Water\|Shape Water]], they began creating snowballs to return fire.)

(x::Another snowball exploded behind them on a rock close to [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s wall. Then another landed near the tree that was hiding behind. They then used shapewater again to make their wall physically capable of stopping one of the snowballs. Just as they finished building their wall, a snowball hit the wall, cracking it immensely and leaving only the hidden stone inside.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to convince [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] again to leave, but Halfie refused; they needed to know who was out there and who was throwing rocks at them. "I know you do," said [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|mordecai]], "but it's come across as you're taunting them. ")

(x::"oh master of people, how do make it sounds like im not taunting them?!" [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] replied half saracastically.)

(x::"What do you think is gonna happen? They're gonna stop coming to join us for a cup of tea?!? That meeting is not going well.")

(x::Another Snowball landed a little too close for comfort while the two spoke. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s ice wall wouldn't hold out for long. Peering into the blizzard, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] struggled to see beyond 10 feet. However, as they stood watching, both had an ominous sense that they had walked into and remained in a trap laid for them.)

(x::Upon feeling this, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] carefully cast Darkness around them so no one could see in, but they could see out. No matter how long they searched, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could see nothing and began to back away from the forest, thinking they must have seen a tree blowing in the icy wind.)

(x::However, as they took a step back, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] watched in horror as a man, covered in a white, fluffy mantle with an ice-blue mace hanging from their waist, pulled back over [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s head and drew the bag closed. On the man's back was a large crossbow. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slowly started to turn as they felt another pair of icy blue eyes glaring at them from behind, wanting to enact the same thing to them.)

(x::Before, they could even fully turn their head, and an explosion emanating from [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] roared like a lion as it enveloped both [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and their attackers. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s eyes were covered in light as flame rolled over them like a tsunami. Thankfully, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was left unharmed by the explosion because their cloak protected them from the heat and flames. Their attackers weren't so lucky as the fire burned and charred them. At the epicentre of the explosions stood [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], covered in soot and their own burning flames. The bag over their head had been cleanly burnt away. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is putting some distance between them, and their barely conscious attacker gave Moredcai a playful wink- this was all going according to plan.)

(x::[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] began their counterattack attack hitting their opponent with a flurry of spells. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began casting their next spell, Wither and Bloom, damaging [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s assault while healing them for the damage they had taken from the [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]]. Both of the attackers now stood hanged over, breathing heavily from the barrage of attacks thrown against them, swinging the weapons with deadly force.)

(x::Both blows landed, knocking the wind out of both party members, but they stood firm. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a deep breath before calming, saying, "I'm surprised you dealt with my first [[Admin/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] so well. I wonder how you'll do with the second one." before a massive orb of flames and fury grew above them and came crashing down on everyone. "bub-bye now" and the explosion, some however more potent than the last destroyed their assiantl.)

(x::Taking advantage of the chaos of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] fired a [[Admin/Spells/Chromatic Orb\|chromatic orb]] at their opponent, killing them as well. However, after a moment of peace, both of them slowly came back to life. Prompting [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to question if this was a silar curse to the Elvan Cannibals.)

(x::Before they could react, the two ran off into the forest, joining a third figure before disappearing. The two stood in silence, their only sounds being the low howling of the wind and their laboured breathing.)

(x::"[[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] is going to be fun", said [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] coyly.)

(x::"Shut up", snarked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].)

# Trivia & Notes
- This is one of the first sessions where everyone was present for at least 4 months.
