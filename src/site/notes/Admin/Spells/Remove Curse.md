# Remove Curse
### *3rd-level Abjuration Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
