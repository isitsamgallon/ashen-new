# Phantasmal Killer
### *4th-level Illusion Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#frightened\|Frightened]] for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

##### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
