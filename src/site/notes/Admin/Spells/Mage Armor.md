# Mage Armor
### *1st-level Abjuration Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
**Duration:** 8 hour

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
