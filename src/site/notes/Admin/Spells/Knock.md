# Knock
### *2nd-level Transmutation Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a [[Chest\|Chest]], a set of [[Manacles\|Manacles]], a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with [[Admin/Spells/Arcane Lock\|Arcane Lock]], that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
