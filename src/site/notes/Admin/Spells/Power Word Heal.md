# Power Word Heal
### *9th-level Evocation Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 action

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points.

If the creature is [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#prone\|Prone]], it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
