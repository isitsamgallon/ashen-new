# Awaken
### *5th-level Transmutation Spell*
**Casting Time:** 8 hour
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the [[Awakened Shrub\|Awakened Shrub]] or the [[Awakened Tree\|Awakened Tree]].

The awakened beast or plant is [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#charmed\|Charmed]] by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#charmed\|Charmed]] condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#charmed\|Charmed]].
