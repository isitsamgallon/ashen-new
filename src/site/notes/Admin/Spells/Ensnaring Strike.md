# Ensnaring Strike
### *1st-level Conjuration Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

##### At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
