# Earth Tremor
### *1st-level Evocation Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 10 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#prone\|Prone]]. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes [[Rules#Difficult Terrain\|Rules#Difficult Terrain]] until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

##### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
