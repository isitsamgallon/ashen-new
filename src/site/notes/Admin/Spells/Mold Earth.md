# Mold Earth
### *Transmutation Cantrip*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** S
**Duration:** Instantaneous, 1 hour

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become [[Rules#Difficult Terrain\|Rules#Difficult Terrain]]. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already [[Rules#Difficult Terrain\|Rules#Difficult Terrain]]. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
