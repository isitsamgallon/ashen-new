# Haste
### *3rd-level Transmutation Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
**Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Actions#Attack\|Attack]] (one weapon attack only), [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Actions#Dash\|Dash]], [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Actions#Disengage\|Disengage]], [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Actions#Hide\|Hide]], or [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Actions#Use an Object\|Use An Object]] action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
