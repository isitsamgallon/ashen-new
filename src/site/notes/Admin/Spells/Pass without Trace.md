# Pass without Trace
### *2nd-level Abjuration Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
**Duration:** 1 hour (concentration)

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ([[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Skills#Stealth\|Stealth]]) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
