# Power Word Stun
### *8th-level Enchantment Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#stunned\|Stunned]]. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#stunned\|Stunned]] target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
