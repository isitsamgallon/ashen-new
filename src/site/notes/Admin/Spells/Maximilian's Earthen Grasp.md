# Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
### *2nd-level Transmutation Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)
**Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#restrained\|Restrained]] target if you do either.
