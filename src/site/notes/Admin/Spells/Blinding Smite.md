# Blinding Smite
### *3rd-level Evocation Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#blinded\|Blinded]] until the spell ends.

A creature [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#blinded\|Blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#blinded\|Blinded]].
