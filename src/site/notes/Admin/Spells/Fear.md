# Fear
### *3rd-level Illusion Spell* *(Concentration)*
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Varies
**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)
**Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)

You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#frightened\|Frightened]] for the duration.

While [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions#frightened\|Frightened]] by this spell, a creature must take the [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Actions#Dash\|Dash]] action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
