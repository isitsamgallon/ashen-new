Many in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] exchanged nervous glances as this was the corridor with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]], the mad wizard. Halfnbie entered the doctor's office and was greeted by a long, crazed man with long, wiry, white hair. The man looked up and shouted, then spoke, "Oh hello, Sonny. Sit your ass down. How can I help?" |
