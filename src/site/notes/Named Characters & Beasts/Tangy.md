| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | As they entered the room, his senses were nearly overwhelmed by the strong scent of the untamed wilds within. He was stunned into silence as he looked around, confronted by trees and other vegetation lining every surface of the room. In the middle stood a man who appeared to be trying his hardest to hide a mischievous grin. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] greeted [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] warmly before introducing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to the priest. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] took a deep breath before performing the 'greeting' to the best of his ability. To both of their surprises, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]'s smile became incredibly wide as he expressed his deepest gratitude for their effort in learning and performing the ancient Pixie greeting for him. Trying hard to suppress the surprise in his voice, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], claiming they should have never doubted him. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] apologised and promised to trust him more in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] turned to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], expressing his joy that they had even brought breakfast, looking hungrily at [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] apologised, stating that it wasn't food but merely a companion on their journey. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] was disappointed but quickly recovered. They all engaged in friendly conversation until [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] asked if [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had ever been to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and if he would like to go. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] cautiously explained that it was a place he had never visited before but was interested in going to at some point. He couldn't say anything else before [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]'s mischievous smile returned. "Great!" he exclaimed as he placed his hand on [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s shoulder before teleporting to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Suddenly, he could breathe, and all his senses rushed back to him as he awoke in a different forest. He spotted something moving in the corner of his mind. In a dazed state, he chased after it, hoping to see a friendly face, but found only an Owlbear cub on the ground motionless. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to see what was wrong, but when he examined the face of the creature, it shifted grotesquely into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]'s, who shouted "BOO!!" in [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s face. Before he could do anything or even get over the initial shock. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] became stern as he warned, "Mama is here, and she looks angry." [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] slowly turned their neck and looked out in horror as a large owlbear howled and charged him down. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] instinctively went to grab the weapon that was no longer there. The last thing he saw was a claw scratch at his eyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | He woke up in a luscious green field with a golden temple in front of him. It was here that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] could no longer take it as his mind snapped into two. He died so many times only to wake to know a horrible death, and his will was only so strong. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] sat at the temple steps, laughing hysterically at the result of his work: the once proud [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] lay on the floor laugh and screaming like a child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Kerrigan, who had been inside sipping tea, heard [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s anguished scream and came to see what was wrong. When greeted with the sight outside, he chuckled slightly and exclaimed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] may have had a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] too much and told the priest to return to his duties. Complaining like a child asked to do their homework, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] returned to the [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] realm. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] approached [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], who refused to believe the world was real. After some time, he finally convinced the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] that he was real, and they finally calmed down. Once calmed and drinking some tea, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] simply stood up and said, "My turn!" before pushing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] over, a feat easily done with his mind in shambles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] slowly calmed down, walking through a place that was truly beautiful beyond words. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] had led him in silence for a few minutes before finally explaining that this specific part of the glad was considered holy and was he first encountered [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had no words. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] continued walking forward, detailing how he came to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] and what he had given up to return to the world of the living. He apologises for taking things too far with him, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] and he were so excited about showing him their homelands that they forgot that a lot of their 'harmless' pranks weren't too harmless to others. He asked if [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wanted to return, and the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] nodded weakly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]] | Finishing their prey, Korrigan asks the priest for his name, the priest introduces himself as  [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]. Korrigan admits that he is struggling since he doesn't understand why he was chosen to be a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] and assumes it's all a part of some grand joke he isn't in on. He explains this is one of the main reasons he joined [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]]'s Druid circle, the circle of endless bloom, so he could become more than just a herald and apart of the fey court in his own right. The Priest advises to lean into the joke, life will become a lot easier that way. Korrigan mentions the man giggling outside and how he wanted to be apart of that joke. upon hearing this. the priest ushers him closer and whispers that that man was a bandit who had just murdered many people right before the party rocked up and they were lucky to get through so easily.  Korrigan recounts some of the harmless pranks he's pulled on people. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] has fun ideas for the joke to play at the party and the priest just laughs and says to carry on with his path. On his way out, Korrigan mentions the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] and apparently, the fey have been sending it all over the place to play pranks on people, although he won't reveal who. Korrigan asked if he could give suggestions as to where to send it next. He suggests |
