| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | At this point, a regular-sized human named [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] emerged, holding one of the Inchlings. He introduced himself simply to the group and expressed his astonishment at the presence of others his size. The Inchling he held, [[ Dill Billington\| Dill Billington]], introduced himself with a refined accent, hailing from the prominent Billington family.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] explained their purpose for being in the territory—travelling through the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Dill Billington\|Dill Billington]], confused by the mention of "Ashen," learned from [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] that it referred to the land they occupied. He did not comprehend that there existed a world beyond their seemingly infinite woods. With careful elaboration, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] conveyed that they were in a significantly larger area, further describing it as an enormous puddle compared to their forest, which left Dill in awe. |
