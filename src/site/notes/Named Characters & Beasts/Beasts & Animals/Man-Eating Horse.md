| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]] | Finishing their prey, Korrigan asks the priest for his name, the priest introduces himself as  [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]. Korrigan admits that he is struggling since he doesn't understand why he was chosen to be a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] and assumes it's all a part of some grand joke he isn't in on. He explains this is one of the main reasons he joined [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]]'s Druid circle, the circle of endless bloom, so he could become more than just a herald and apart of the fey court in his own right. The Priest advises to lean into the joke, life will become a lot easier that way. Korrigan mentions the man giggling outside and how he wanted to be apart of that joke. upon hearing this. the priest ushers him closer and whispers that that man was a bandit who had just murdered many people right before the party rocked up and they were lucky to get through so easily.  Korrigan recounts some of the harmless pranks he's pulled on people. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] has fun ideas for the joke to play at the party and the priest just laughs and says to carry on with his path. On his way out, Korrigan mentions the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] and apparently, the fey have been sending it all over the place to play pranks on people, although he won't reveal who. Korrigan asked if he could give suggestions as to where to send it next. He suggests                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Eventually, they reached a clearing when suddenly [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] began to hear the undead's moans again, but this time, there seemed to be a lot, and they were coming this way. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] hurriedly explains that Leomund's Tiny Hut normally takes about 10 minutes to cast due to its complexity. But they have a way to make it take about a minute. With the sounds of skeletons coming from all sides, they have little choice but to surround [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and protect them while they perform the sped-up ritual. First, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] casts his healing spirit centred on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and summoned the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] then used their meta-magic to carefully cast [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2058-darkness) so enemies would find it much more difficult to hit them if they got close but wouldn't affect them. Suddenly, Skeletons appeared out of the fog and began to attack them, but with the aid of the set-up and the use of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s Area-of-affect attack, they were easily able to defend themselves against the oncoming hoard of enemies. Then, as they said it would, after a minute, Leomund's Tiny Hut sprung into existence, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] collapsed out of exhaustion from the immense amount of focus the act required. The rest of them decided to also get some rest while they were safe within the confines of the spell.                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | On one side of the room is an impossibly large amount of [[Gold\|Gold]]. On the other side is the Mummy Lord, seemingly asleep, in front of the Lord is an onyx black sword. They all hesitate before entering, [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|Poems from the Sand Dunes]] still had some unused poems, however, none of them could figure out how they might be used in this situation. Korrigan summons the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] to interact with the room and once it touched the gold coins, the Mummy Lord awoke. [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] starts to shake violently upon its revival and sand begins to fall from the ceiling. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are then presented with a dilemma: the door to the room is slowly closing, should they enter or leave? All but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] were able to dive into the room before the door shut. Now they were left face-to-face with the master of the temple. The Mummy Lord speaks angrily in Infernal to the group, Mordecai, being the only one to speak the language responds with Message. The Lord is confused, not knowing where he is. Mordecai tries to explain he is in a temple on the boundary of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], The Mummy Lord's anger and confusion increase as he is unaware of those names. He exclaims, that he is the ruler of a grand and ancient kingdom in the desert where many adored him. They then make the link between the poem and the Mummy Lord's life and explain he was betrayed. This only seems to fully unleash the lord's wrath, as he summons his sword from the ground and stands from his golden throne. |
