| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | Once everyone has woken up, Drache and Korrigan explain what happened last night and the group decides it is best to get a move on so they can try and outrun  [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it was best to take the route that goes through [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]. Along the way, they encounter a man in the middle of the road with a knife in his leg. They call out whilst Korrigan looks in the foliage on either side of the path and finds multiple [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] hiding and waiting to jump them. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | Strangely, once all of the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] were dead, they slowly came back to life and started to attack them again. Chenris used [Command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2032-command) and told them to Flee so that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] could get a chance to run away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
