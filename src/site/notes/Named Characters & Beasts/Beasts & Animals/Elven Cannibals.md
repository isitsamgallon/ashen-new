| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | Once everyone has woken up, Drache and Korrigan explain what happened last night and the group decides it is best to get a move on so they can try and outrun  [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it was best to take the route that goes through [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]. Along the way, they encounter a man in the middle of the road with a knife in his leg. They call out whilst Korrigan looks in the foliage on either side of the path and finds multiple [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] hiding and waiting to jump them.                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | Strangely, once all of the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] were dead, they slowly came back to life and started to attack them again. Chenris used [Command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2032-command) and told them to Flee so that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] could get a chance to run away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 14\|Session 14]] | For some reason, Chenris is in charge of directions and gets everyone lost in the forests where they're attacked by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]]. Everyone tries to reason with it, but to no avail until chenris speaks in Elvish and they get some broken responses. Korrigan manages to charm the cannibal, and Chenris convinces it to take them out of the forest. As the party moves more, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]] arrive, and they get chased by hunters. Everyone runs away. The charmed cannibal returns to the path, where he is compensated with a health potion. |
