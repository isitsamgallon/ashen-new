### Overview
During [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s second trip to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], they ended up getting very drunk at a frat party. At the time [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]]'s summons, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]] and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bobs\|Bobs]], had been killed in a recent battle and required resummoning. unfortunately he attempted this while drunk at the party and while blacked out he accidentally summoned a demon that he married. 

Once he woke up the next day Bronumas was happy to see their husband and couldn't wait for the wedding and honeymoon. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] immediately broke off the engagement, much to Bronumas distain and threatened to have their brother beat up [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]] | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained he would join in, but the last time he drank, he got mad and became a demon. With slightly slurred speech, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they had heard from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Bronumas, The Devourer\|Bronumas]] since the divorce. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that he was thankful he hadn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] slowly woke up, they tried to piece together what had happened the previous night[^1]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was still looking in horror at his new husband, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Bronumas, The Devourer\|Bronumas, The Devourer]], tried to quickly come up with a reason why they could not be married anymore. But as he asked some clarifying questions, the demon revealed that they would never get a divorce otherwise, his brother would come and beat [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] up. They weren't intimidated until the demon showed them a terrifying picture of his brother: A vast and terrifyingly strong-looking demon[^2], which dashed any thoughts of getting a divorce. That was until [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] came up with a lie that he actually was already married and, therefore, their marriage wasn't legitimate, but before he could apologise, the demon called him an Asshole before storming off into a portal back to hell. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]] | to his horror something responded to his calls, a demon called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Bronumas, The Devourer\|Bronumas, The Devourer]]. who slowly turned over next to him and asked if he wanted anything and when did they want to start planning their wedding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
