### Overview
Magic Demons are powerful trickster entities which are known to be the primary inhabitants of [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]]. They were first encountered by [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] when he met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] and learned they had turned him mad during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They were later accounted for again in [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 15\|Session 15]] during the destruction of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. 

in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] met [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]'s headteacher, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], who explained how, during a research study, he sent students into [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to harvest more crystals to create [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. sadly, the trip was one way and would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. 

It seems that the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] retain some of their memories and personalities after their creations, as two of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]'s friends were turned into these creatures and came back to haunt him and turn him mad. 

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] seems to be affiliated with them.
