### Overview
Magic Demons are powerful trickster entities which are known to be the primary inhabitants of [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]]. They were first encountered by [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] when he met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] and learned they had turned him mad during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They were later accounted for again in [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] during the destruction of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. 

in [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] met [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]'s headteacher, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], who explained how, during a research study, he sent students into [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to harvest more crystals to create [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. sadly, the trip was one way and would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. 

It seems that the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] retain some of their memories and personalities after their creations, as two of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]'s friends were turned into these creatures and came back to haunt him and turn him mad. 

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] seems to be affiliated with them.

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The headmaster revealed that making more towers was possible but would involve getting crystals. The only way to do this was to convert people into purely magical energy and send them to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to get crystals. However, the journey was one way as the people would often die or would slowly be turned mad. With sadness, the headmaster revealed that they lost a lot of very talented pupils doing this, which is why it is forbidden. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then went uncharacteristically serious and asked if, before this, there had been any known sightings of a beast known as the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. The headmaster said yes and explained that the primary theory was that anyone who died in [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] was turned into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. After a short pause, they asked if someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] studied at [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]          | Chenris instantly disappears to the top of the tower to find his research paid off and everything is as he expected it to be, bar one thing. In the chamber with the crystal were [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. After getting over his initial shock, Chenris greets them with, "Oh, hello there. I believe we have a mutual acquaintance, one [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]          | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] flies up to find Chenris starting to take apart the Crystal with his magic. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] join to help him destroy it. Midway through this process, Mordecai finally reaches them and attempts to stop Chenris, but is completely ignored. Mordecai then tries to physically restrain him, but is stopped by Ebis, who is sent to the floor with a spell. Chenris is now very close to destroying the crystal, and Mordecai is desperate to at least get his attention, let alone stop him, and attempts to stab his leg. He misses, but chenris turns to see what is happening. Through tiers, Mordecai tries to tell chenris to stop. He doesn't know what he's doing - anything to stop him from going any further. Chenris gets in his face and goes, "It is just Scientific Enquiry, my boy", and returns to his work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Halfway through his investigation the flow of time slows, fearing the influence of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], Chenris readies himself for combat but is instead confronted by, what can only be described as, two demons that appear on the mad mage's shoulders. Chenris questions if they are the reason for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]'s current condition and they conform his suspicions saying its really funny. Chenris ask why they would do this to such a bright mage. The demons laugh and state they did this because he was poking his nose in a place it shouldn't belong and we needed some entertainment. After getting over the initial shock of such otherworldly creatures, Chenris is able to determine these a creatures as what the academic community call [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]], hailing from The Realm of Magic. A place deeply entangled but distinct from one that all humanoids walk, and the source for all the world's magic. Not much is known about this realm or the creatures before the elf, but one thing if for certain, Chenris was in the presence of some very powerful creatures and one wrong move could spell his end. Putting up his best facade, Chenris laughs and acknowledged that is hilarious to watch such a great mage fall from such heights to the shivering mess of a man before him. The demons give great belly laughs before saying in a much more serious tone "You should also watch what you stick your nose into." before disappearing and allowing for the passage of time to continue as normal. Winterbor excitedly asks if he is ready for a grand tea party. Chenris, holding back his panic, affirms his readiness and tells him he will be picked up when the time is right and makes his exit with Winterbor returning to his antics. |
