After much onside flirting, the man introduced himself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] of [[Locations/Jub’s Tribe/Jub's Tribe\|Jub's Tribe]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]]                                 | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] eventually handed over a bag of sticky [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] plushed as he explained that he and his friend had made it to get the [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] ready for them before he left. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] quickly put the bag on the floor, thanking [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] for his generous contribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Next they go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], they find him smoking a pipe. Korrigan wants to know if there's anything they can to stop having their minds messed around with magic. Terrence tells a story of how ghost literally fucked his head. The wizard allegedly wore a hat to protect himself, He struggles to remember. he finally remembers that he wore the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Crown of Trues Sight\|Crown of Trues Sight]], lets the wearer see the world as it actually is, and not how people want you to see things. Terrance's prototype broke but the real artefact is out there, although he doesn't know where it is. it should be with a creature that likes to see what everything should be. Chenris had heard of the crown before, it was made by the goblins and it admits an aura that gives this ability to those around. He suspects either [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]] might be the owner of the crown. |
