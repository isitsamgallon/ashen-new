### Overview
The Lord of [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] was forced to have a long, very misogynistic conversation with him to try and gain [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Lord Enelion's Favour\|his favour]]. Chenris hoped this would aid them in getting a trade deal between [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Flore seemed to be constantly accompanied by guards and many sex slaves who were all under the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm) spell.
