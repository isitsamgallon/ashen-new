### Overview
The Lord of [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] was forced to have a long, very misogynistic conversation with him to try and gain [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Lord Enelion's Favour\|his favour]]. Chenris hoped this would aid them in getting a trade deal between [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Flore seemed to be constantly accompanied by guards and many sex slaves who were all under the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm) spell.

| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 13\|Session 13]] | As they are leaving the inn they ask the clerk how one might get an audience with the Emperor which she doesn't know but assumes it can’t hurt to have the backing of some of the monarchs. One of them, Folre Enelion IV Esquire, is often found on the beaches outside. They find the lord along the beach surrounded by at least 30 women, who on closer inspection are all under the charm spell, meaning they are not here of their own free will. This makes Korrigan irate but the rest of the party manages to calm him down and take him away. Chenris approaches the man, greeting him with a traditional Nobel Elvin greeting. Enelion is a very fat and disgusting man who is incredibly sexist as well as very pro-slavery. Chenris dances around the subject before picking his moment to ask for some kind of favour to meet the Empress. Chenris explains that he, and his concierge, are on a diplomatic mission from another country to make a trade deal but weren’t given many resources to complete the mission. The Lord gives a Harty laugh before looking at the rest of the party incredibly confused. “Why is your party made up of so many halfbreeds and… a human”. Chenris’ mind raced to come up with an excuse before saying, “Meat shields, wouldn’t to deface by perfect skin in a skirmish, would I” |
