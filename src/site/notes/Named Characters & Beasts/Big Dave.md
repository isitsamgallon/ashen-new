| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | With their note written and left with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]][^1], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] headed out with their destination set for [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had marked the general area of the university but soon found that knowing the exact location wasn't necessary, as when they approached the area, Mordecai and Halfbie would feel the magic emanating off of the university miles away. Putting away the map, they followed the magic that filled the area around them.                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | At this point, a regular-sized human named [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] emerged, holding one of the Inchlings. He introduced himself simply to the group and expressed his astonishment at the presence of others his size. The Inchling he held, [[ Dill Billington\| Dill Billington]], introduced himself with a refined accent, hailing from the prominent Billington family.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | When asked about leisure activities in [[Locations/OFC/The Inchling Kingdom\|the Inchling Kingdom]], Dill admitted they did not engage in sports but highlighted their fishing competition, in which [[ Parsley Billington\| Parsley Billington]] had previously been the reigning champion until [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] arrived. Due to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]]'s popularity, they refrained from imposing a height restriction on the competition. The kingdom operated under a communist structure, allowing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] to efficiently gather food, resulting in a culture of enjoyment for the Inchlings. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | Initially hesitant due to assumptions about the kingdom's food supply, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ultimately accepted Dill's invitation. They gathered for a meal, which [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] joined. He explained that the Inchlings primarily consumed fish and berries[^6]. Expressing a desire to assist in cooking, he noted the kitchen staff were not accommodating to his size, humorously unaware of his physical limitations.                                                                                                                |
