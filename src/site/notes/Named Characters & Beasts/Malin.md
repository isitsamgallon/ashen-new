### Overview
The priest that represents [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. He considers himself a moderate in the faith, condemning [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] for its huge loss of life and immense suffering. However, it was revealed that he originally fought in the war as a commander of an [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] legion. He has since seen the error of his ways and left to right his wrong.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ends the connection between him and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and returns to the cavern. In a slight daze, they return to face [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], who stands to the side with his head bowed respectfully. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awkwardly asks if this is when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants to do it, and if so, does he have a way he wants to go? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] says that he doesn't really care as long as it is painless and soon, so he won't have to deal with the fiery explosions that come with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' return. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is confused, wondering why he would want to die now as surely he would be sent straight to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], who was bound to be furious with the priest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | Although [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is the God of Fire and Cleansing, he is also the God of Violence and War. When his soldiers and followers die, their souls get sent to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s eternal battlefield, where they fight a myriad of monsters, demons and beasts. Moderates who had given up on war go to the same place but are put in a separate area, which is covered in fire, and people are in great pain. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is the general of his army and is too busy to come to see the moderates, so it is believed that even though the existence will be painful, it will be peaceful. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] whispers to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], wondering if it might be better to Kill [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] with Ice magic so he won't be as affected by the fire in the bad place. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] didn't respond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | Looking slightly pissed off now, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] surmises that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants them to destroy the tower and then kill him so he doesn't have to deal with the fallout - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] agrees. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] analyses the tower and notes that the crystal isn't at the centre of it like the others. Instead, the crystals line the walls and focus on the tower. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] touches on them, and a husky and laboured voice whispers to him, "[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]." [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s head snaps in the direction of the voice, and it is one of the black wraiths they saw in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordacai also recognise them from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked about The Tower, noting its distinct difference from the other towers before becoming slightly confused about what [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] were. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he was here before The Tower or Temple was built. Before the temple was around, there was nothing, just an empty plane. Then, a crystal crashed on this land, causing an enormous crater. Sometime after, A dragon appeared, and she explained she would use the crystal to ensure [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] wouldn't happen again. The people, still mourning the loss of their friends and family, desperately agreed. The dragon spent months and months building something that could use the crystal. Eventually, he was successful and went around the world using fragments of the crystal to build more towers all over. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] and the other priests soon gathered around to protect it, creating a church over it to hide it from [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] and anyone who might have bad intentions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asks if they do kill him, will they be hunted down for his death? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explains that this room is rarely used and is not known to many people. Additionally, many of the staff do not enter the different rooms dedicated to the Gods; they would not know he was dead for many weeks or even months. After [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked, he confirmed that the number of people, excluding [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], who knew of this room could be counted on one hand. Without a moment's hesitation, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] drew his bow and shot [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] in the head. The arrow buried deep in the priest's eye, threatening to come out the other side. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] crumpled to the floor, dead instantly. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained to the shocked members of his party that killing him now would ensure that no one related to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] would ever be able to find out about The Tower and would serve to buy them time. They admitted he had a point, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and Aidan were annoyed that none were given a say.                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him.                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | It is late afternoon when they arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] is nervous about being around the area with Aidan's possession and their last interaction with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]' staff [^2]. They all decide to walk around the town and make camp in the forest nearby. Still mentally exhausted, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says it might not be worth it to use their Tiny Hut spell and have a night watch like normal. They all agree. while figuring out watch partners, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is insistent that he watches with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], who happily accepts. With everyone asleep, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] is eager to carry on their training, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] refuses, stating that he has a few things he wants to talk about. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] expresses that he feels incredibly lost at the moment; their adventures feel incredibly chaotic, and they're finding themselves incredibly lost with what is happening. At the start, this was fine as it meant he could focus on the fighting and defending, but not it becoming too much. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is also feeling very guilty about the death of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Outside, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took a deep breath as they mentally prepared to enter [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' room. Questioning out loud if this was really the correct thing to do. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suggested that I couldn't hurt to ask, worst case, they could all step in to help if it came to that. Slightly reassured, they all entered the room. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] was sitting near the altar reading as they all entered. He greeted them warmly, asking if there was anything he could do to help. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dodged around the subject as they asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] knew of someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he knew of her when they both fought in the war and explained that she was a great general who gave her life to destroy an entire army Battalion. He explained that in some circles, she is regarded as almost a sudo [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] comes clean and explains that they actually found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], and she currently has processed his brain. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] looks terrified and asks to know the full story and becomes increasingly terrified when they explain how they found [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] and then [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], now on the verge of panic, begged to know that the sword was safe and hidden away still. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] deliver the troubling news that the sword was stolen by someone they suspect to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] broke out in a cold sweat and told them to follow him as he walked incredibly quickly for an old man. He took them out into the main library and into the back areas through a door labelled 'Authorised staff only'. Down a few corridors, they walked through a heavily guarded gate and down a steep flight of stairs. until they entered a large and dark room - illuminated only by a pristine white pillar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that they shouldn't be down here, but he assumed they needed access to one of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] and a room where no one could hear them. He paused for a moment before continuing. He explained that they needed to kill him because it was the only way for them to justify their being down here after they were finished, and he didn't want to be around for what was to come. Seeing the pillar, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suggested talking to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] to get some much-needed answers. Getting comfortable, he went through the usual motions, and before long, they stood before [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], who greeted them warmly:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This question stumps the priest as he had never thought of that before, he doesn't have an answer. Chenris is about to leave when stops to ask one final question, "Do you know anything about one master Ebis?" the priest had heard the name but only as someone leading a magic guild somewhere. Mordecai asks if he knows anything about the grand plan. The priest hesitates before explaining, that the grand plan is often about how [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] wants to start [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Second Sundering]]. At this point the priest wants to confess that he was a general in the original army and led a legion of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]], however, he feels immense guilt for his actions and is trying to reform, his name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]]. They thank him for his time and leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
