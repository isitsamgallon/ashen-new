| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 43\|Session 43]]              | Watching his friends safely go through the gate, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] returned to the house with all the alcohol in it, grabbed as many bottles as he could, and returned to their tent. Inside, he began fashioning [Molotov Cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail). [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] helped make them. While making them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that the wooden gate went to the huntsman's quarters. After the slave revolt, they were separated from the main slave population to help prevent another one. Once all the Molotov Cocktails had been made, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] attached long fuses to them and placed them all over [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Slums\|the slums]], mainly in abandoned buildings and near the wall. He wanted to create a distraction to help the other escape. Once they had all been set, he lit the fuse and returned to the tent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 43\|Session 43]]              | In the tent, he found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] had started to make an ointment from the medicinal herbs. She pointed at the burn marks on [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]’s arms, and he gratefully accepted the ointment, which didn’t heal anything but made the pain a lot better. They then hid everything by burning it and tried to get some rest. A little after the explosions started, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] returned and excitedly told [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] about the bow he had managed to stash away, making [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] very excited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]              | He then asked if they had managed to get their food in time. That was when they realised none had remembered to grab food, but luckily, they had the radishes from the priest. The man tried to refuse [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] sharing the food with them, but they didn't care and broke off a share for him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] insisted he take some food for being so kind to them and for asking for his name. He introduced himself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and the little girl as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]              | After their shift, they were escorted out of the mines to get their rations for the day. Determined to get their food this time, they followed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] to the mess hall. Inside, they were given small, dirty bowls of gruel. Outside, the antimagic field was powerful, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] traced it somewhere on the central city's other side of the wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

While preparing to announce the drinking contest, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] noticed a man with heavy facial scarring staring at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] intently. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] gets two beers, and Misty Steps over to the man and offers him one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to calm him down and told him to start from the beginning and explain how their [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] works. After a few deep breaths, they explained that their version works slightly differently from the more common version. He functions by taking him through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s before appearing in the spot he wanted. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] paused for a moment before suggesting that maybe their ability malfunctioned and sent [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] but left them there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] filed with his bow for a moment before saying that could be the case as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no way out of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and so could be trapped. A moment passed for [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s eyes widened in panic as he screamed, "OH MY GOD, [[The Party/Halfbie\|HALFBIE]] IS IN THE [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|FEYWILD]]!" before teleporting there himself. He landed in his usual spot: outside a golden temple dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He threw out his magic, searching for this friend and breathed a sigh of relief, and he sensed them moving to them slowly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | Mordecai fails to trigger a wild magic surge a few times. While Korrigan Misty Steps out of the cage and attempts to pry open the bars. He uses one of his Sprite Totems to give everyone some basic healing and to increase his physical strength enough to bend the bars in a way that lets Mordecai slip through. With Chenris still out of commission, the two-way up their options, they think about just killing her and being done with it, but they're worried that that would kill Chenris first. In the end, they decide to just restrain and blindfold her so they can buy some time and wait for everything to blow over. Eventually, the hour was up, and Chenris woke up feeling quite craggy and weird. Suddenly snapping back into focus, he asks for a complete rundown of what's happened. Once he heard that charms still had a few minutes left, he suggested using that time to learn some more. They ask about the staff to see what abilities it may have, only to learn that it's just decorative and has no abilities. They also learnt that the witch is a warlock of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], explaining that she just likes the abilities she gets from him, she doesn't care much for the God himself. Unsure if this news should reassure them or worry them, they turn around to discuss their next moves.  She is a warlock with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | Upon seeing their companion close to death, Chenris and Korrigan - two known for their disregard for social norms - [[[Misty Step\|[Misty Step]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step ) into the makeshift arena. Chenris casts [Command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command) on both of them to tell them to leave. It works on the dwarf but is countered by Damascus, who sends the command right back, but the elf is unable to leave due to the wall. "You should know boy that those spells don't work on the likes of me" snarled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] before turning his attention back to Drache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 09\|Session 09]] | Chenris freed himself and gave Korrigan the help action to try and find the mage again since Korrigan has the best vison out everyone. They find the mage and start trying to attack and get a number of hits off on the mage, but not enough to kill it. As this is happening, gravity is getting stronger and people are starting to lose consciousness. To make matters worse, Mordecai spots [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] approaching the party with large battle axes and a legion of Goblins. As a last ditched effort, chenris uses [[[Misty Step\|[Misty Step]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) to appear next to the mage but misses his [Inflict Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/inflict-wounds) and the whole party blacks out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
