### Overview
First met in [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 41\|Session 41]], Misty was one of the first slaves [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] met in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. She lived in a tent within the mines of the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|siltwater slums]], and compared to most others,  lived in relatively good conditions. She notably had a very close bond with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], the person she lives with and takes care of her. 

She was notably Mute because a guard cut out her tongue. It is currently unknown what the original reason for this action was.

### Description
#### Appearance
Misty looks like a regular 14-year-old girl, but she is a lot dirtier, skinny, and wears rags instead of regular clothing.

#### Personality
Despite the [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions\|conditions]] in which she lives, she is exceptionally happy and can often be found smiling and laughing while playing with whatever she can find. 

She is exceptionally kind and wants to help those around her in any way possible. This is best shown when [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] was preparing to start a second revolution. She noticed that his arms had metal burns on them, so she tried her best to make an ointment out of some of the herbs he stole from the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia. 

### Relationships,
#### Tish
[[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and Misty have an almost father-daughter bond, as she deeply cares for him. It is currently unknown how they came to be so close; they're not related by blood, but it has been implied that she was born into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]].

#### Korrigan
[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] cares very deeply for her safety and tries his best to ensure that she is always kept safe. 

#### Mordecai 
[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and Misty have a sweet relationship. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] often tries to perform magic tricks on her to distract her from anything nasty or to simply entertain her while the others are talking or walking places. Either way, she is a massive fan and has never seen someone who can do these tricks before.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]]               | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] appeared running through the courtyards and collapsing to her knees, tears spluttering as she saw [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]]'s harrowing fate. She fell entirely to the floor as she cried over her father's death. "You were the best father I never had..." she thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]]               | With the gates unguarded, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] led the way to [[Groups & Factions/Luminara\|Luminara]]. Before crossing the threshold, he looked over his shoulder to check on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], who seemed fine, having stayed on the sidelines during the fight. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], "All right, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], what's the plan?

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]]               | After helping make the Molotov cocktails, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] drew a detailed map of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] pointed out choke points they could use. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to Aiden, pointing at the wall where the bow and armour were, and asked him to sneak down to grab them. Aiden nodded, sneaked off, and quickly returned, having not been spotted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Donning the armour, they both begin trudging through [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], inspiring more crowds. Suddenly, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], amongst the carnage of slave breaking and setting fires to everything, noticed he couldn't see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]].

He was about to throw a Molotov at the gates before a black figure jumped down off the wall and sliced the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]]'s throat with a small knife.

Inside, he began fashioning [Molotov Cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail). [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] helped make them. While making them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that the wooden gate went to the huntsman's quarters. After the slave revolt, they were separated from the main slave population to help prevent another one. Once all the Molotov Cocktails had been made, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] attached long fuses to them and placed them all over [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], mainly in abandoned buildings and near the wall. He wanted to create a distraction to help the other escape. Once they had all been set, he lit the fuse and returned to the tent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

She pointed at the burn marks on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]’s arms, and he gratefully accepted the ointment, which didn’t heal anything but made the pain a lot better. They then hid everything by burning it and tried to get some rest. A little after the explosions started, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] returned and excitedly told [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] about the bow he had managed to stash away, making [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] very excited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The man tried to refuse [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] sharing the food with them, but they didn't care and broke off a share for him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] insisted he take some food for being so kind to them and for asking for his name.

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] gets two beers, and Misty Steps over to the man and offers him one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

After a few deep breaths, they explained that their version works slightly differently from the more common version. He functions by taking him through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s before appearing in the spot he wanted. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] paused for a moment before suggesting that maybe their ability malfunctioned and sent [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] but left them there. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] filed with his bow for a moment before saying that could be the case as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no way out of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and so could be trapped. A moment passed for [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s eyes widened in panic as he screamed, "OH MY GOD, [[The Party/Halfbie\|HALFBIE]] IS IN THE [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|FEYWILD]]!" before teleporting there himself. He landed in his usual spot: outside a golden temple dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He threw out his magic, searching for this friend and breathed a sigh of relief, and he sensed them moving to them slowly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | Mordecai fails to trigger a wild magic surge a few times. While Korrigan Misty Steps out of the cage and attempts to pry open the bars. He uses one of his Sprite Totems to give everyone some basic healing and to increase his physical strength enough to bend the bars in a way that lets Mordecai slip through. With Chenris still out of commission, the two-way up their options, they think about just killing her and being done with it, but they're worried that that would kill Chenris first. In the end, they decide to just restrain and blindfold her so they can buy some time and wait for everything to blow over. Eventually, the hour was up, and Chenris woke up feeling quite craggy and weird. Suddenly snapping back into focus, he asks for a complete rundown of what's happened. Once he heard that charms still had a few minutes left, he suggested using that time to learn some more. They ask about the staff to see what abilities it may have, only to learn that it's just decorative and has no abilities. They also learnt that the witch is a warlock of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], explaining that she just likes the abilities she gets from him, she doesn't care much for the God himself. Unsure if this news should reassure them or worry them, they turn around to discuss their next moves.  She is a warlock with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. |

Chenris casts [Command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command) on both of them to tell them to leave. It works on the dwarf but is countered by Damascus, who sends the command right back, but the elf is unable to leave due to the wall. "You should know boy that those spells don't work on the likes of me" snarled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] before turning his attention back to Drache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Chenris says he'll be right back and returns to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and tells them what he saw up there before saying, "Terribly sorry, but there are few things i wish to investigate. Good day" and before Mordecai could even protest, Chenris uses [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2195-misty-step) to return to the room. Panicking, Mordecai breaks his connection with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and tries to find a way up quickly to the room above with the crystal.

Quickly Chenris wakes them up and explains the situation. As he is explaining the situation he notices that all the mimics in the room are starting to leave the room. Going outside the room they find that all the furniture is trying to leave the house as a whole. It dawns on Korrigan first "Are they leaving because the house is going to start digesting us?"
