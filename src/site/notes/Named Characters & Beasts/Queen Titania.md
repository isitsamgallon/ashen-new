### Overview
The leader of the [[Locations/Feywild/Seelie Court\|Seelie Court]] in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Like many fey creatures, she is mischievous and likes to play pranks on people, sometimes very cruel ones. She seems to have a particular disdain for [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] due to his nature of being a human transformed into the Fey by [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thought for a moment before opening an old and ratty notebook. As they flicked through the pages, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] watched in horror as each one was filled with tally marks. They covered every surface of the page and seemed to get increasingly hectic and incoherent as they fluttered by. Each one clearly told the story of a person slowly losing themselves in making the marks. A lot of the pages were also covered in blood, which [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] could only hope wasn't [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] takes them inside the temple, ensuring [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gets a proper meal before leaving the plane. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was grateful for the meal, although a little disappointed that it was chicken Noodle Soup. After finishing their meal, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] called an aid and told them to give his regards to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] before grabbing [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and transporting them back to the human realm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Finishing their prey, Korrigan asks the priest for his name, the priest introduces himself as  [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]]. Korrigan admits that he is struggling since he doesn't understand why he was chosen to be a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] and assumes it's all a part of some grand joke he isn't in on. He explains this is one of the main reasons he joined [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]]'s Druid circle, the circle of endless bloom, so he could become more than just a herald and apart of the fey court in his own right. The Priest advises to lean into the joke, life will become a lot easier that way. Korrigan mentions the man giggling outside and how he wanted to be apart of that joke. upon hearing this. the priest ushers him closer and whispers that that man was a bandit who had just murdered many people right before the party rocked up and they were lucky to get through so easily.  Korrigan recounts some of the harmless pranks he's pulled on people. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] has fun ideas for the joke to play at the party and the priest just laughs and says to carry on with his path. On his way out, Korrigan mentions the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] and apparently, the fey have been sending it all over the place to play pranks on people, although he won't reveal who. Korrigan asked if he could give suggestions as to where to send it next. He suggests                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Korrigan, satisfied with finally knowing what is going on, takes Chenris and Mordecai to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] and guides them to what is known as the [[Locations/Feywild/Seelie Court\|Seelie Court]]. A place priming with magical fey energy where all of the Arch Fey gather to discuss their plans. Its a large room and on the outskirts are seats for all the beneficiaries. Opposite the door, are 3 seats one presumable for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], one on her right Korrigan as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] and one her where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] - the head of the court is sat. She stands to announce that court is now in session.  With that the excited hubbub subsides to give space for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] speak, She asks what they want - noting that the non-fey are only here as they are with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]]. Each word escaping her mouth as if it was a challenge to even cordial in the presence of someone who can challenge her authority. Korrigan starts to explain their sudden need for the court to convene but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] cuts him off as she already knows what he wants and he can't have it. Mordecai speak up and after a long back and forth, manages to convince her to consider their plea. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] doesn't care for the well being a human nation but admits it might be funny to allow them to make their plea to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|feywild]] and see who answers their call if they make a deal with her. Korrigan asks what sort of deal she would like and confesses he only wants one thing: Chaos and instability. In return for calling on the fey for support he must see for chaos than normal. Korrigan instantly agrees before the other two can question what she means by this. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] laughs as the deal has been made. She excited exclaims that the Tiefling's magic is now even more unstable and will happen more often, Mordecai's jaw drops as he starts to panic.     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] then turns to Korrigan and asks if that is all. Korrigan, clearly still angry at Chenris's betrayal, says "No, make him suffer". With glee on her and a chorus of laughter from the fey around them he says "You elf, you must help korrigan here when the time is right. You must also deal with the same magical instability or lose our support entirely!". Without any options, Chenris agrees and the whole court erupts in laugher that is almost deafening to the 3 of them. As they are leaving, the two confront korrigan for his stupidity, with Mordecai exclaiming "Do you even know what you've done?!?" Korrigan apologises, saying he had no idea she would be so unkind. Chenris chips in saying that its happened now and we finally have a chance at winning this war. With Mordecai unwilling to explain his outburst of fury and tears any further, falls to the back of the group with his emotions all but seeping out of him as they return to the war room. Declaring they now have enough troupes for the war, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] lets out a large sigh of relief. Everyone now thoroughly exhausted from a day of strategy, revelation and negotiations they turn to go to bed. With little else to do and some still stunned from the revelation, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] join him and go to bed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
