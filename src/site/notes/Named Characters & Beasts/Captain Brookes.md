| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 07\|Session 07]] | They venture to the house that they were sent to and find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Brookes\|Captain Brookes]] living there as if he had always lived there. The party carried on the bit of doing the questionnaire and found that he thought he quit the guards and moved into this house for a few months now. Inside Korrigan spots a book that had been left on the side table, it had been placed open and face down indicating it was the book the captain had just been reading before the party knocked at his door. Looking closer, korrigan notices that it was written by Merek the wise. He points this out to Chenris subtly, leaving the elf to burn with anger for a moment before masking his rage, like a doctor turns off their emotions,  as to not scare the captain. |
