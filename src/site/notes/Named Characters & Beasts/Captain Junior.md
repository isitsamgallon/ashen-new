[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] (much to the fear of the rest of the party) strike a deal of information exchange for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]]'s soul contract, which Chenris reluctantly agrees to. Chenris ends up learning about the [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and Korrigan's plans to do something to the pillar in lost haven on behalf of lorwyn. For some reason the party also left these in charge of directions resulting tin the party going the wrong direction. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], concerned that Korrigan had picked up Chenris’ navigation skills, pointed out they needed to turn around. |
