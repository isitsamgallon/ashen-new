| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]] | Soon after returning, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] set off for [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decided it would be best to find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Shoni Anofora\|Shoni Anofora]], rather than risk needing help from [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] again. He quickly discovered a tavern down the road where the bartender, a dwarf, was speaking simply while pouring drinks for various customers. When Aiden asked about Shoni, the bartender replied, “I’m no good at remembering. Do you have something to jog my memory?” Reluctantly, Aiden pushed a few extra coins across the counter, and the bartender began to speak more formally. He explained that he had heard of Shoni and that she was last known to be heading south. With another payment, he detailed that she was working in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the Desert]], beyond [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]]. Aiden thanked him for the information and returned to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], who refused to believe him, citing the bartender's poor command of Common. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]] | As the jurors began to murmur among themselves, many seemed to have already made judgments about the boy. One remarked that it appeared everyone would be better off with both [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and Aiden alive. Just as Aiden's despair deepened, the next witness was called: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Shoni Anofora\|Shoni Anofora]], the realm's leading expert on possession. She revealed that she was currently possessed by at least three deities and that she knew a way to keep them at bay and control them if they took over. The judge pointed out that Aiden had never sought out this knowledge, suggesting it might have been an option for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]] | “And…?” she prompted. After an uncomfortable pause, he finally explained that there is always a choice regarding whom you care about more: the family you were born with or the family you find. Exasperated, she asked if there was anyone he planned to seek out when he left. He responded that he would try to find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Shoni Anofora\|Shoni Anofora]], whom he had met at the trial. With a simple nod, she shooed him away, and he awoke in the material plane once again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
