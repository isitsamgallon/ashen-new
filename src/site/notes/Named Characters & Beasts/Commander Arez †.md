### Overview
A high-up Dragonborn commander in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. He was only ever seen wearing his armour made from pelts and hides made from the many strong beasts he had slain over the years.

### Notable Information
- The way he fought and presented himself, Arez was a massive pervert who took great joy in killing and taunting his prey. He was killed, alongside [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]], in [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. 
- His most memorable moment during the fight was when he counter-charmed [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] and had him attack [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Korrigan was able to break free and ripped him apart with [Thorn Whip](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thorn-whip) towards the end of the fight.
