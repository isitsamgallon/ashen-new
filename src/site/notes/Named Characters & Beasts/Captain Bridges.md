| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Despite their victory, the cult leader escapes, leaving [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] frustrated and on edge. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]], taking charge, offers to escort them to [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] for rest and recovery, noting the cult’s heinous deeds and his regiment’s efforts in dismantling their operations. The group, with no memory of how they ended up in the cult’s clutches, reluctantly agrees. As they march toward [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], Bridges repeatedly asserts his name and authority, leaving the group to ponder the mysteries surrounding their capture and the challenges still to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | The journey to [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]], offered the group a chance to reflect on their escape and bond amid the tense atmosphere. The quiet forest trail, marked by dappled sunlight and the faint scent of the sea, provided a deceptive calm. As Bridges shared the region's history, the group learned of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]] and its unique credit-based economy, posing a challenge to their reliance on [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]]. Entering the weathered port town, the adventurers found its resilience remarkable despite its scorched buildings and wary inhabitants. At the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]], they secured membership and lodging while navigating strict regulations, including a law against unlicensed magic. Chenris complied, purchasing a licence, but Mordecai defiantly refused, setting the stage for future complications. |
