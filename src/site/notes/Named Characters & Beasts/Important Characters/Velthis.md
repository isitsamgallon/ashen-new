### Overview
The Arch-Necromancer of [[Groups & Factions/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]] and the mastermind beyond the disappearance of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. He was first encountered in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] found thousands of black-robbed cultists performing a complicated spell around the city that involved black tendrils stretching out towards the centre of the city. Velthis was described as being at least 2-3 times more powerful than [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] - A mysterious person who was described as being able to easily defeat the whole party. 

Velthis forced the party into entering [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]] and retrieving a crystal he could use for his plans to move Dawnhaven.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | An hour after [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], they all reach the remaining frame of the airship, with parts still on fire and a shattered crystal found in the centre of the wreckage. On the walls that hadn't burnt down, the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo could be seen, immediately raising suspicions of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. While investigating, Aidan is able to confirm that the ship is not the same one from earlier in their adventure. Upon seeing the dead bodies, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] goes incredibly quiet as he tries to hold back his panic. They all begin to edge close ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] less so) to try and learn more from the wreckage. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] takes this time to analyse the magic around the ship and learns that there are faint traces of strange magical energy, information [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] instantly links to the large wave of magic that spread out from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] 's work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also realises that that crystal absolutely shouldn't have shattered since they're quite durable and important to keeping the airship in the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | The man sighs before saying "My name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]], I'm a part of [[Groups & Factions/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]] and I'm trying to save the people of this city. Errr I take my whisky on the rocks. My clock has had a weird stain on it for years and I never bothered to wash it off. I'm here in the palace to make sure Galen doesn't do anything stupid."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | With their question answered [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] leaned forward and explained what their task was. They are to go into the crypts under the city, where their circle meets, and retrieve a crystal hidden behind a door. He explains that they'll need a special tool to retrieve the crystal and asks who the smartest among them is. They all silently point at Chenris. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] nods and passes the device through a portal to Chenris. It had a large shape spike on it and a box with many cogs on it. Chenris was immediately interested since he had never seen such a device before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] then opens a portal to a very dark and old-looking area that they presumed to be the crypt. and begun to shoo them off to do their job. Chenris immediately gets up to go through. korrigan asks if the man will tell them about the spell happening outside of Dawnhaven but the man refuses and they should be lucky he has been so lenient with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | Mordecai smugly points out that he can't possibly help with this with how badly his foot was broken. Without a word, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] opens a portal behind him and grabs him by the scruff of his clothes. Mordecai was about to complain that he was ruining his clothes when he saw a sword come out of the portal. The sword easily cut off his leg before catching it. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] then cast some purple magic on the severed foot before reattaching it to Mordecai's body. The foot was healed but was no longer fully connected to his body and would probably slowly die off. They also have no sensation in that foot but can still move it like normal. Horrified by what just happened, the party silently followed Chenris into the portal after he called out to them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] offered to the the same for Chenris' arm but he refused, saying he was quite all right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | Mordecai asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] what she thinks about all of this. She admits that she is unsure since nothing like this has ever happened in Ehobel. She is mainly focused on completing their task so they can get away with their lives. As they walked down the path they encountered a small room with animated skeletons roaming around it and a [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Note From Velthis About Reanimated skeletons\|note]] on a nearby table. Chenris used a [[Admin/Spells/Mage Hand\|mage hand]] to grab it. It read as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | The Party try to theories why they were attacked, if they're all working for the same guy. Chenris suggests that these people might have been taken over by something and it probably doesn't matter to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] as he wins either if they die or manage to retrieve the crystal. Korrigan and Aidan find a bunch of [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]] on a nearby table. Aidan says as they were the ones who found it, they should be the ones to keep it. Korrigan gets mad at the fact that Aidan would be so greedy and demands that they should share it evenly with the whole party. Aidan relents and they share out the gold evenly. Korrigan tries to give some gold to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] but she is uncomfortable taking it since she already has so much and gives it to the party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | The party attacks the create all at once making quick work of it due to the massive amounts of damage it had taken from the Korrigan's lightning bow attack. Figuring they were close to the crystal they pressed on and found a room with a large ruby vein and some dead bodies. the bodies had nothing on them oddly enough and without anything to mine the vain they pressed on down the path. on the right was a small room with a golden altar with golden blood-soaked cloth covering the altar's Idol. On the side was an [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Diary Entry Found In The Crypts of Dawnhaven\|old diary]]. They didn't have any time to read the diary as at the end of the corridor was a wooden door, the same one mentioned by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | Chenris gets out the device given to him by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] earlier and there is now a light blinking on it. The closer he moves to the crystal the faster it begins to blink faster. The shades also became a lot more erratic as well as becoming more and more exciting that someone was about to sacrifice themselves for the crystals. The party were dumbstruck as the pieces finally fit into place, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] wanted them to do it so he wouldn't have to sacrifice himself. However, none were exactly jumping at the idea of sacrificing themselves for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]]' potentially evil plan. That was until Chenris got his expensive bolt of wine from his pack and poured himself a glass before nominating himself with a calm and neutral tone "Oh I'll give it a go". The party turned him in shock, as the man who was so selfish was not offering up his life so they could live. The only one who wasn't surprised was Korrigan as he quickly realised that because chenris was dying he probably saw this as the most efficient use of his death.                                                                                                                              |
