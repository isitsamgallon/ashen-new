| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | The only other option they had at the moment was travelling to Fort Molden and finding a way to take back their previous wealth from the [[Other Information/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said it would be essential to do that, but it might not be worth the trouble at the moment until they solved the rest of their issues. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they split up; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could research both forts and prepare the golems while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] spoke with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert Thornwood]] to secure support for the raid.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] made their way up [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the black tower]] to where the old councillors' officers were. In one of the rooms, they found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert Thornwood]] sitting at a desk in a well-lit room. There was a fire lit before it, which clearly also burned out. Near the fireplace, two [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit cutters]] stood hand on hilt, glaring at the outsiders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], without removing their gaze from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]], shot a [[Admin/Spells/Fire Bolt\|fire bolt]] at the fireplace, reigniting the fire. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] let out a shuddering laugh and sarcastically thanked his son for helping them, stating that it was starting to get cold. "Maybe that's suitable for your reading hairline." hissed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to help by explaining that there would be a lot of [[Other Information/Money\|money]] available if the raid were successful; however, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] did not care about the [[Other Information/Money\|money]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] said with a grim smile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] beckoned [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] closer with a scared finger and leaned forward to whisper in the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]]'s ear. "[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] you are already lower than me." He then got up from his desk. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a war to prepare for." As he left the room, his guards followed at heel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 50\|Session 50]] | They quickly returned to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the Black Tower]], where they got into bed and began to drift off. Along the way, they had decided that [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the Golden Fleet]] would be too difficult for them to take on. However, if they went to [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to get their [[Other Information/Money\|money]] back, they could stand a chance, as they could fund the army that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert Thornwood]] was creating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had spoken to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and realised that [[[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] Thronwood\|[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father]] would make a great candidate for leading the military and could help them get their art/ exports into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that after a rather annoying conversation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] agreed to help them with the military and would even sell their art to the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit cutters]] on the condition that they give him a new pair of legs. It was something [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hoped [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could help with, since they were good at building things. |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] soon built the legs and a wand for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. He worked with [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] to create a pair of prosthetics made of wood and with the prestigitation spell built into them. They were programmed to make a spark every time [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] took a step, but for the first 8 hours, he was the only one not to notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | Leaning against the door, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] asked what he should get started on first and instead pointedly suggested that it would be the art. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] defensively said yes, but had no idea why that should be. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] helpfully chimmed in, explaining that running a military without capital would be difficult. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] immediately brightened to the idea and commended [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] for their smarts. While looking down their nose, they wondered why [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't be more like his friend.                                                                                                                         |
