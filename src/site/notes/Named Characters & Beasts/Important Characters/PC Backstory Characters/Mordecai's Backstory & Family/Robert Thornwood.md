| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had spoken to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and realised that [[[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] Thronwood\|[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father]] would make a great candidate for leading the military and could help them get their art/ exports into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that after a rather annoying conversation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] agreed to help them with the military and would even sell their art to the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit cutters]] on the condition that they give him a new pair of legs. It was something [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hoped [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could help with, since they were good at building things. |
| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] soon built the legs and a wand for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. He worked with [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] to create a pair of prosthetics made of wood and with the prestigitation spell built into them. They were programmed to make a spark every time [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] took a step, but for the first 8 hours, he was the only one not to notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | Leaning against the door, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] asked what he should get started on first and instead pointedly suggested that it would be the art. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] defensively said yes, but had no idea why that should be. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] helpfully chimmed in, explaining that running a military without capital would be difficult. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] immediately brightened to the idea and commended [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] for their smarts. While looking down their nose, they wondered why [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't be more like his friend.                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | "This is for difference between you. Someone who understands the world." growled [[Robert Thornwood\|Robert]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
