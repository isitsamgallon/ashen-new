### Overview
Robert is [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s biological father and was the main reason [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was unable and fearful about returning to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Since his defeat in [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]], he has taken up residence in the OFC after being kicked out of the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]].

### Description
#### Appearance
Robert is an average-sized [[Other Information/Races/Human\|human]] covered in battle scars. He is missing many of his limbs, including a leg, an arm and some fingers. All of which have been replaced by prosthetics.

#### Personality
Robert has a cold and cruel personality, especially towards his son, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. He enjoys war and being unkind to those around him that he sees as weak, or even worse, weak-willed. He can be incredibly spiteful and prideful, often to his own detriment.

Having worked in the military, or because of his Spiteful personality, he is incredibly strict, especially around how people address him. he does not care for people calling him Robert or any other nickname and insists that people refer to him at minimum as Mr Thornwood.

##### Mordecai
Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s magic randomly activated, he seemed to be fine with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], if a little disappointed that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] didn't take to the blade as well as their siblings had. However, after the incident, Robert blamed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] for actively killing his wife and youngest children. He never attempted to find out what actually happened. he ruthlessly hunted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] out of Uvam and set up specific patrols to make sure [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could never return without being killed or in fear.

Immediately after his defeat, he was bitter and spiteful that his child had not only beaten him unfairly, but also kept him alive. He desired to die a warrior's death and saw [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s mercy as not only weak but disrespectful of how way of life.

Now that he lives in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]], he is the leader of the military force and takes great pleasure in mocking and annoying [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. His favourite way to try to convince [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that they aren't much better than him

##### The Party
Robert doesn't have many strong opinions about [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]]'s members, except that he loathes being under their command rather than the other way around.

- He seems to have great respect for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and for people who served in the military.
- He seems to be ok with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], mainly because they seem to respect him, calling him Mr Thornwood at all times (even without being asked). Halfbe also doesn't seem to shy away from being called a 'butcher' or 'murder' like the other members of their Party, which is a quality he admires in himself and his people.

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | The only other option they had at the moment was travelling to Fort Molden and finding a way to take back their previous wealth from the [[Other Information/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said it would be essential to do that, but it might not be worth the trouble at the moment until they solved the rest of their issues. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they split up; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could research both forts and prepare the golems while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] spoke with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert Thornwood]] to secure support for the raid.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] made their way up [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the black tower]] to where the old councillors' officers were. In one of the rooms, they found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert Thornwood]] sitting at a desk in a well-lit room. There was a fire lit before it, which clearly also burned out. Near the fireplace, two [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit cutters]] stood hand on hilt, glaring at the outsiders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], without removing their gaze from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]], shot a [[Admin/Spells/Fire Bolt\|fire bolt]] at the fireplace, reigniting the fire. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] let out a shuddering laugh and sarcastically thanked his son for helping them, stating that it was starting to get cold. "Maybe that's suitable for your reading hairline." hissed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, if they went to [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to get their [[Other Information/Money\|money]] back, they could stand a chance, as they could fund the army that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert Thornwood]] was creating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had spoken to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and realised that [[[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] Thronwood\|[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father]] would make a great candidate for leading the military and could help them get their art/ exports into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that after a rather annoying conversation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] agreed to help them with the military and would even sell their art to the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|fruit cutters]] on the condition that they give him a new pair of legs. It was something [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] hoped [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could help with, since they were good at building things. |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] soon built the legs and a wand for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. He worked with [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] to create a pair of prosthetics made of wood and with the prestigitation spell built into them. They were programmed to make a spark every time [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] took a step, but for the first 8 hours, he was the only one not to notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | Leaning against the door, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] asked what he should get started on first and instead pointedly suggested that it would be the art. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] defensively said yes, but had no idea why that should be. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] helpfully chimmed in, explaining that running a military without capital would be difficult. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Robert Thornwood\|Robert]] immediately brightened to the idea and commended [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] for their smarts. While looking down their nose, they wondered why [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't be more like his friend.                                                                                                                         |
