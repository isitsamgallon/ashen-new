| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]         | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] steps back and nervously says they absolutely cannot be here and should bury the crown and leave as soon as possible. Korrigan stands in front of Mordecai and asks them what about the teachings of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] they like and points out how these 'cleansing flames' killed their [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|mother]] and burned their house to the ground. Before they can finish the sentence, Mordecai slaps him. Korrigan sees the slap coming and lets it land, never breaking eye contact with the Teifling. Suddenly the damn broke, and korrigan started shouting that Mordecai had watched them all slowly become puppets of the gods and was meant to remain free of all that. Mordecai fires back, saying everyone, even the gods, has abandoned them. This power would allow them to clean the slate and start fresh finally. Korrigan's eyes narrowed as he said, "Do you know why the smartest people end up working for the worst people? It's because they are better at rationalising the wrong things they do". Korrigan lets Mordecai through to get to the crown before saying that Mordecai was the one who taught him that. Mordecai begins to say something before the voice in their head speaks again, saying that their power can make everything ok again. Mordecai grabs their head again, shouting and screaming for the voice to get out of their head. They begin to break down as they exclaim how alone they are and want to be loved.                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]         | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] opens the door a little further and finds that the red cloaks don't have bodies; they are just large motes of flames. Many more floating flames were hovering around the room, keeping it bright. The Firesoul Greatsword was floating a few feet off the ground in the middle. Mordecai is highly tempted to grab the blade as the voice tells them to claim their prize. Mordecai resists the urea but becomes irritated when the voice mocks him for not figuring out who they're being possessed by. Korrigan says "Hi Ebis" on a whim to the voice. The voice laughs as it exclaims that she is way better than that pretender. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks if the voice is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]]; she says she is much better than that fool, saying, "They are nought but a twinkle in my eye". The voice begins to tease them that being in Mordecai's mind is very fun as they get to know so much about his past, including that letter to their father and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle's death]]. Mordecai tells the voice to get out of their head that they don't need an army and they don't need any help. The voice laughs manically as they explain that all of their efforts are pitiful compared to the power of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. Mordecai was also told not to worry about it, as although they can't control Mordecai's body yet, soon they will, and it won't matter.                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]     | They return to the main library area where Korrigan says that Aidan needs to learn how to use his magic. He explains that it often activates when you really need to use the magic and while the magic does come from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], it is Aidan's will to do what he wants with the energy. This helps him calm down until he hears in his ear "or my will" from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Some time later, Chenris and Mordecai return from [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|Aeloria's room]] looking incredibly troubled, especially Mordecai. Chenris still looks incredibly angry, still in his summer form. Korrigan tries to ask what happened and all Mordecai can muster is a meek sorry. He goes on to explain that he was offered a deal and now looking back he really regrets not taking it. If he had, then everyone would know all about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and so much more but it came a step cost of himself. Taking the deal would lead to him forgetting everything about himself and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|his mother]] all of him would be gone and would start from scratch. upon hearing this Korrigan is on verge of tears and gives him the biggest hug and explains that he received a similar deal but he at least got to keep most of his memories. Mordecai start to weep and Korrigan comforts him by saying it ok, if you think about it we didn't even know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] existed a few weeks ago and they learnt so much since then, we can always learn about the dragon the old fashioned way. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]]     | Chenris decides to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] to ask questions about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]] and his disappearance. Ebis isn't able to help with a lot of details but points him in the right direction to find out more. After this, Chenris leans in and asks about him transforming in to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]]. Ebis denies knowing anything about this but after some pushing he gets up locks the door and transforms into the leader of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]], then quickly into Suicide bomber from the airship. He then switches back into to Ebis, unlocks the door and says "And no one will believe you". Chenris tries to calmly walk out and as soon as he is out of earshot of Ebis he runs like hell to his books to to figure out what he just saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]     | Chenris and Mordecai became spell casters in very different ways. Chenris learnt through studying and researching magic, whereas Mordecai was born with it. Because of this, Mordecai could not control his powers until he had practised a lot. But before that, he was a child with no control, and when he was first tapped into his magic, he accidentally cast a fireball in his family home - a very wooden house. Mordecai could escape the fire without much harm, but his family and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]] weren't so lucky. Without a family or a roof over their head, Mordecai wandered the lands of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] before meeting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] at the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]]. Over time, he learn to control his powers but hid them as best he could so he couldn't hurt anyone again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | Mordecai was next, removing his [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|mother's]] cloak from his shoulders. With tears rolling down his face he tries to smell her one last time but her perfume faded with the years of campfire smoke. With a final goodbye, it his added to the fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
