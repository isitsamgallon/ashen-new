Arwen is a very obese half-elf, who was first mentioned by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Cindy\|Cindy]] and is the owner of the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]]. In his office, there are many pictures of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] with his eye cut out. There are many dead [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s under the pictures, written above them, presumably in their blood "Mordecai stole my heart". 

Arwen is known to have worked with the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] but it is unknown to what end. He had also kidnapped [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] and was forcing him to rob the clients of the Nightshade's Crown

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 09\|Session 09]] | Chenris freed himself and gave Korrigan the help action to try and find the mage again since Korrigan has the best vison out everyone. They find the mage and start trying to attack and get a number of hits off on the mage, but not enough to kill it. As this is happening, gravity is getting stronger and people are starting to lose consciousness. To make matters worse, Mordecai spots [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] approaching the party with large battle axes and a legion of Goblins. As a last ditched effort, chenris uses [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) to appear next to the mage but misses his [Inflict Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/inflict-wounds) and the whole party blacks out. |
