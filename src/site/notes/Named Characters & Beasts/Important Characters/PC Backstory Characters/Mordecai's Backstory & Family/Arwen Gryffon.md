Arwen is a very obese half-elf, who was first mentioned by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Cindy\|Cindy]] and is the owner of the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]]. In his office, there are many pictures of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] with his eye cut out. There are many dead [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s under the pictures, written above them, presumably in their blood "Mordecai stole my heart". 

Arwen is known to have worked with the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] but it is unknown to what end. He had also kidnapped [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] and was forcing him to rob the clients of the Nightshade's Crown

| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]]               | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked at both, unsure of who they should believe. "Hmmm, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] i think you have to eat these coins," said [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], and after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked why, he said, "Well, if you die now, then you'll never be able to stick it to the man, you know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen]]"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]]                 | Next was a heavily obese half-elf, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen]] Gryffon, who froze [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] on the spot. The man hobbled with a large bucket of chicken grease and a greasy bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. He handed the coins over before turning to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], delighted that the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]] remembered him. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried ot get the man to leave as soon as possible, but Arwyn had no intentions of leaving so soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | As soon as they did, their minds were filled with visions of war, anger, hate, death, and injustice throughout the world. A female voice began to narrate the rampant lies and hatred that infected this world and how it could also be solved with the power of a cleansing flame. As this happened, the island was shaken by a large earthquake that threatened to destroy the castle. Mordecai was about to pull away before what the voice said made sense, and they began agreeing. The voice started to talk about the people in their lives, like their father, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]], who would wash away the beautiful flames of justice. Mordecai leaned against the table, using [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2213-prestidigitation) to cause small flames to wrap and move through their fingers as one would with a coin; darkness seemed to cloud their face, obscuring their finer features. They mutter about how things could be better this way and give in to the irresistible urge to wear the crown. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to weave a spell while Korrigan drew his bow, ready to stop Mordecai from picking it up. At the last moment, Korrigan stopped and let his bow down - curious to learn what might happen. Noticing this, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] does the same, trusting that Korrigan might know something they don't. At the last moment, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] used his slow-time ability to rush over and grab the crown. He knocked it out of Mordecai's hand, leaving it to roll and clatter on the cobblestone floors. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) to quickly grab it and lift it 35ft in the air. |

| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]          | Chenris and Mordecai became spell casters in very different ways. Chenris learnt through studying and researching magic, whereas Mordecai was born with it. Because of this, Mordecai could not control his powers until he had practised a lot. But before that, he was a child with no control, and when he was first tapped into his magic, he accidentally cast a fireball in his family home - a very wooden house. Mordecai could escape the fire without much harm, but his family and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]] weren't so lucky. Without a family or a roof over their head, Mordecai wandered the lands of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] before meeting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] at the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]]. Over time, he learn to control his powers but hid them as best he could so he couldn't hurt anyone again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 09\|Session 09]] | Chenris freed himself and gave Korrigan the help action to try and find the mage again since Korrigan has the best vison out everyone. They find the mage and start trying to attack and get a number of hits off on the mage, but not enough to kill it. As this is happening, gravity is getting stronger and people are starting to lose consciousness. To make matters worse, Mordecai spots [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] approaching the party with large battle axes and a legion of Goblins. As a last ditched effort, chenris uses [[[Misty Step\|[Misty Step]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) to appear next to the mage but misses his [Inflict Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/inflict-wounds) and the whole party blacks out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
