| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | As they tried to comprehend what was happening, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly began coughing violently, with waves of blood flooding their hands. The coughing soon became too much, even causing them to lose consciousness. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] rushed to help, but their limited healing magics did not support or even ease the pain of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s lung rot. She ran off to find a healer while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] finally snapped out of their trance and moved [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] into the palace, where the doctors were.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 41\|Session 41]] | With their conversation concluded, they entered the fort. It was much emptier than when they last visited, presumably because many of them were at the [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]]. Walking through the streets, they eventually came across a freshly made marble statue of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tugged at [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s sleeve and asked if he could make some flowers to lay at the statue. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] sadly explained he couldn't do it at the moment as he didn't have the spell prepared, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] could probably. The druid quickly stepped up and cast the spell Plant Growth, causing a field of flowers to bloom around the statue.                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], still on the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] with her giant ice spider, hurried to escape from [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. They could hear shouts and screams from within the fort as they rushed to raid for the chaise. While [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] panicked and attempted to devise a plan to get out of this situation, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly took out their [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and began casting a spell to rewrite aspects of the world. The spell changed the problem so that the people in the fort were no longer angry with them and were willing to offer a choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | While leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to get some rest, the other came up with a plan. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] found an herb commonly used as an anaesthetic during operations. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] practised the cuts using the claws he had got from his primary savagery ability. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was encouraged to make sure [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was okay during the process while helping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] recoiled for a split second before leaping into action, summoning a flurry of white-gloved hands made of spectral magic to begin scooping the foul ichor away. Her face was fixed in a mask of horror and determination. Every scoop of the pus dissolved like tar into the soil, hissing and burning the ground. It wasn’t just filth—it was wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | Unbeknownst to them, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] was attacked by a Druid and a pack of wolves. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's Fireball had killed a few of the wolves, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] finished off the others. The druid proved more difficult, firing bows from the cover of trees and bushes. Eventually, they cornered the druid using [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's Web spell. Just as [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was about to hit the druid, it Wild Shaped into a large spider and began to fight back with fangs and poison. Eventually, the druid was defeated, with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] ensuring that it wasn't killed, as he seemed to recognise the druid, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] Riverstone, from his dreams as his "friend."                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | Once they realised this, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] healed her back to health so they could chat. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] exclaimed that he had seen [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] in his dreams and had been worried about her; she coyly remarked that if he missed her so much that he dreamed about her, he should've gotten in contact sooner. When asked, she explained that she was attached because these were her woods, and most of the people who ventured through weren't very kind and often tried to kill the animals around them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained to the group that they used to work together on the other side of the mountain, close to the board of the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. She must've travelled down to this forest afterwards, which would explain why they hadn't run into each other since they had been down to this region before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] elaborated by saying she moved here when the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]] cut down their tree house, which outrages [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who had wanted to go to one ever since they were little and even offered to help Sylvia get revenge. Before they knew it, they had all decided to go and get revenge, with Sylvia taking it one step further and announcing that they should kill all the fruit Cutter for all the crimes they committed. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] was less enthusiastic about this; however, it was easily convinced. |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | Feeling the awkward silence, Sylvia asked what they were all doing in her woods. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] simply stated that they were on the Tour Du Ashen as if that cleared everything up, much to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] 's enjoyment. He complained about how nerdy he sounded to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] smirked and told Sylvia that the name and plan were his ideas and he wouldn't want to take credit for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | "So she rebuilt your body so it's not your original body?" questioned [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | Excited to be adventuring with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva Riverstone]] again, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] jumped up, teleported them to the temple, and excitedly showed her his statute. She thought it was cool, but she wanted one herself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
