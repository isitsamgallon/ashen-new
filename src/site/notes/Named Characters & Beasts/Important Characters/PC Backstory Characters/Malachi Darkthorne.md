| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] entered the court stand on a balcony above everyone's heads as their screams continued. His eyes surveyed the crowd, and he seemed calmed by his presence. His eyes meandered until they locked with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s. His disdain was evident even from a distance. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s face twisted into a mischievous smile as he mockingly greeted the king. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] returned the smirk, saying, "I wondered when you'd be back"                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | He then raised his golden arm to the Nobel crowd, and a brilliant golden light shot from his palm, turning everyone in the crowd to gold. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] explained that he refused to let his people get hurt again. Holding his gaze on [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], he smirked before saying, "I do have a surprise for you, though..."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | "You know what? I'm not into Mad Kings. I'm sorry. It's not my style. I do like playing catch, though. And he shoots an arrow," replied [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], and quickly drew his bow and fired an arrow square at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]]. He did not react to the arrow's feel on his golden skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | With a click of his fingers, a pair of side doors swung open as Sara's hulking, golden form entered the courtyard. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] froze, his jaw gaping, as a singular tear ran over his cheek. Another then followed. His legs gave out as he fell to the floor, unable to hold back the torrent of tears and emotions. Satisfied, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] turned on the spot and returned inside the palace, the doors clanging shut behind him.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slowly awoke to find themselves in an exquisite room filled with gold and brilliant white marble furnishings. The room was filled with incredibly lifelike statues of people in various states of fear, tears, and pain. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] commented on how little taste [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] has. However, no words left their mouths. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] found the same was true for them. They both looked down, and to their horror, their bodies, up to their eyes, were made completely out of gold.                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | Before the two could even begin to panic, a grand door opened, and two figures walked in. One was covered in his usual robes, which [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had recognised instantly, and the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|other]] bore the crown of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. A flicker of hope crossed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s eyes as they recognised [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] replied with an enthralled smile, excitedly pointing to some of his new favourites in the collection. He gestured at a few, including Slyva, who seemed to have a defiant look on her face. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to use the [[Admin/Spells/Dispel Magic\|dispel magic]] spell by subtly spelling it; however, the antimagic field appeared already active. In fact, from their vantage point, it seemed like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] was actively trying to ignore them, whether he could hear them or not.                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] sat at a grand table in the heart of the room. It was, too, made of solid gold. Malchai poured him a cup of tea. Genturing to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], he explained that they were the most recent ones; he caught them a few hours ago messing with Sara.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly realised that while the antimagic field was active, it hadn't been for long enough to be at full power, allowing them to use the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] spell. They tried to [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], but still refused to reply or even react [^1]. The two talked about a range of topics around politics until the topic eventually turned to the rebellion, where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] said, "We'll have to quell this rebellion as soon as possible. I recommend sending all your guards straight into the quarters." [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] nodded in approval, and once they finished their team, they began leaving the room. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] stopped in his tracks, the air around him becoming very tense. He turned to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and asked, "How does the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] know your name?" The silence was deafening in the room before it was broken with a long, exasperated sigh from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. Before anyone could react, he turned on the spot and punched [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] in the stomach. The force was enough to make the king vomit before passing out.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Suddenly, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|a man in ornate clothes]] and a decorated crown entered the room, cackling wildly. He ordered a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] to pick up the half-alive [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]]. He looked at his machine, saying, "It's alright, my pet. You put up a good fight." he then turned to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] "Well, you tried, and that's all we can hope for." And with a cruel laugh, he punched [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] unconscious.                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They kept walking forward, ready to make their message clear: **The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|king]] would die today.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | The crooked, built-all-too-familiar handwriting of King [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi Darkthorne]] read, "They died, and it was all your fault." Upon reading this, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] lets out a guttural scream of rage as all his memories finally returned with the sensation of a white hot blade being stabbed into his mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | We tried every single peaceful thing. By 17, we were seen as a symbol of hope. We operated out of a pub, secretly running underneath my father's forge. We called it the Ember's Refuge. That's where I was heading down towards the day yesterday. But soon after my 18th birthday, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi]] the King ordered our execution. We did nothing aggressive. We didn't, you know, we weren't planning attacks. It was all peaceful. Broke into our houses and slaughtered some of the resistance. He slaughtered Alandra in front of me and my father.                                                                                        |
