| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Suddenly, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|a man in ornate clothes]] and a decorated crown entered the room, cackling wildly. He ordered a guard to pick up the half-alive [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]]. He looked at his machine, saying, "It's alright, my pet. You put up a good fight." he then turned to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] "Well, you tried, and that's all we can hope for." And with a cruel laugh, he punched [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] unconscious. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They kept walking forward, ready to make their message clear: **The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|king]] would die today.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]] | The crooked, built-all-too-familiar handwriting of King [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|Malachi Darkthorne]] read, "They died, and it was all your fault." Upon reading this, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] lets out a guttural scream of rage as all his memories finally returned with the sensation of a white hot blade being stabbed into his mind.                                                                                                                                                        |
