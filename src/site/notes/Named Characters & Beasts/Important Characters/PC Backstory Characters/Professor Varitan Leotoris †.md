### Overview
Leotoris was a professor at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], where he taught Magical Theory. He met [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] soon after he started his studies at the University. Chenris and Leotoris would spend a lot of time after class together researching theories and managed to greatly increase the world's understanding of magic theory.

### Notable Information
- Leotoris was an incredibly kind man and quickly became a father figure for Chenris after they bonded after class and worked on problems together 
- After some time like this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] was going on a field trip to a local dungeon that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] had wrapped nearby to. Having never really been out of the confines of the city, Chenris begged to go on the trip. Leotoris finally relented and snuck his name on the list. 
- Unfortunately, because Chenris was inexperienced with dungeons, he accidentally triggered a trap, but at the last second, Leotoris jumped in and saved him and died in his place.
- With his dying breath, he passed him [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]] and said, "Learn all the secrets of this world and solve this problem if it's the last thing you do."

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]         | Asked if their boss had the same [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo on their clothing, and they confirmed that this was the case and had vague memories of the university but wasn't sure when asked if he knew who [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] was. They explained that they were on the airship because they were on some kind of expedition to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], but they weren't sure what the expedition was for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]     | Noticing that chenris is still seething, asks what happened. Chenris explains curtly everything about his soul and the deal he was offered for the same information but for him it would remove his memories of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]]. Korrigan reminds the elf that when it comes down to it, its the memory that counts not the note itself. Calming down, Mordecai hesitantly asks if he would like to hold on to [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|the note]] from now on and after a long sigh he says yes. Korrigan joking ask for the magic words to which Chenris replies "Fuck off". Mordecai hands him the note with them both knowing this was a very big sign of trust. Korrigan also returns the Squirrel Staff. When Chenris grabs the staff, his vision shifts to show a [Mummy Lord](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16962-mummy-lord) picking up the squirrel, his eye flash as a wave physic damage washes over chenris as the Mummy lord crushes the squirrel and his vision returns. Suffering from a massive headache Chenris explains what he saws and surmises that they might need to deal with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] sooner rather than later. Korrigan uses [Animal Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) to tell [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] what is happening and to come join them in the Pyramid for a fight. Mordecai asks if they should prepare and Chenris points out that his [[Other Information/Unique Items/Alchemy Jug\|Alchemy Jug]] has made 7 greater health potions. he would've been able to make more but they were often busy that he didn't have time empty the jog. He gives 3 to Mordecai, 1 to Aidan and 2 to Korrigan. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]     | Chenris asks for information on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis]]. The orb says they will have to strike a deal for this information, as chenris wants information about someone's character then it's only right he gives information about someone else character. Their deal would mean chenris would forget all the information about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]]. The orb laughs and says he doing Chenris a great service, he would get a lot of information in exchange for forgetting something that has scared him so deeply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]     | Mordecai steps in and asks what he would have to give for the same information. The orb says because he isn't a part of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] the deal would be a lot harsher. This deal would lead to Mordecai forgetting everything about himself. Chenris starts circling through all his emotions as he silently contemplates his options. Mordecai tries to tell him that this isn't right and he shouldn't take the deal, although he is unaware if chenris can hear his pleas or not. The orb tries to bargain with more information like info on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and "how to make them treat you right". Chenris hears within the whirlwind of information in their head, that the first part of the passcode is the name of the person who the Auditors]] (Chenris forgets this after the conversation is over). The orb states that he just has to give this information over and he would be free. In chenris' head, he things back to all his memories of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]], the good and the bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
