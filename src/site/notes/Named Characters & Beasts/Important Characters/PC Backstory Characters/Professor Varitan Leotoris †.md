### Overview
Leotoris was a professor at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], where he taught Magical Theory. He met [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] soon after he started his studies at the University. Chenris and Leotoris would spend a lot of time after class together researching theories and managed to greatly increase the world's understanding of magic theory.

### Notable Information
- Leotoris was an incredibly kind man and quickly became a father figure for Chenris after they bonded after class and worked on problems together 
- After some time like this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] was going on a field trip to a local dungeon that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] had wrapped nearby to. Having never really been out of the confines of the city, Chenris begged to go on the trip. Leotoris finally relented and snuck his name on the list. 
- Unfortunately, because Chenris was inexperienced with dungeons, he accidentally triggered a trap, but at the last second, Leotoris jumped in and saved him and died in his place.
- With his dying breath, he passed him [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]] and said, "Learn all the secrets of this world and solve this problem if it's the last thing you do."

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]     | Noticing that chenris is still seething, asks what happened.

Korrigan reminds the elf that when it comes down to it, its the memory that counts not the note itself. Calming down, Mordecai hesitantly asks if he would like to hold on to [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|the note]] from now on and after a long sigh he says yes. Korrigan joking ask for the magic words to which Chenris replies "Fuck off". Mordecai hands him the note with them both knowing this was a very big sign of trust. Korrigan also returns the Squirrel Staff. When Chenris grabs the staff, his vision shifts to show a [Mummy Lord](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16962-mummy-lord) picking up the squirrel, his eye flash as a wave physic damage washes over chenris as the Mummy lord crushes the squirrel and his vision returns. Suffering from a massive headache Chenris explains what he saws and surmises that they might need to deal with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] sooner rather than later. Korrigan uses [Animal Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) to tell [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] what is happening and to come join them in the Pyramid for a fight. Mordecai asks if they should prepare and Chenris points out that his [[Other Information/Unique Items/Alchemy Jug\|Alchemy Jug]] has made 7 greater health potions. he would've been able to make more but they were often busy that he didn't have time empty the jog.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]     | Chenris, slightly ticked off from being unable to write up his notes, starts to explain his past. Chenris says, as everyone knows, he went to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] as a child. In his Magic Theory class, he met the late [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]], who became almost a father figure to Chenris - especially since his relationship with his father was…strained. Chenris and Leotoris would spend a lot of time together researching theories after class and significantly increased the world's understanding of magic theory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Having never really been out of the confines of the city, Chenris begged to go on the trip. Leotoris finally relented and snuck his name on the list. Unfortunately, because Chenris was inexperienced with dungeons, he accidentally triggered a trap, but at least in the second, Leotoris jumped in, saved him, and died in his place. With his dying breath, he passed him [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]] and said, "Learn all the secrets of this world and solve this problem, if it's the last thing you do."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
