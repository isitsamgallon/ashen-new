### Overview
Malachi is the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] and the primary antagonist of the Freedom's Flame saga. He is an incredibly cruel man with an obsession with all things gold. He is even known for turning people into golden statues who still have the ability to think but not move. 

### Description
#### Appearance
Malachi is a slender man dressed in luxurious attire, including an ornate crown. He possesses a golden arm and has long, dark hair.

#### Personality
Malachi is an incredibly cruel man who takes great joy in hurting people he sees as lesser. To him, salvery in the harshest of conditions, where the slaves, who have often been kidnapped from their homes, is not only acceptable but necessary to maintain the lavish lifestyle of himself and the people of [[Groups & Factions/Luminara\|Luminara]]. 

He is known to be ruthlessly killing, maiming and experimenting on the slslaveshat live in the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|siltwater slums]]. This was most evident during the [[History & Events/First Lost Haven Slave Revolt\|First Lost Haven Slave Revolt]], when he personally joined the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|Lost Haven Guards]] in quelling the rebellion and took great delight in specifically torturing and then brutally killing all of Ka1's friends in fropnt of him before 'killing' [[Kal †\|Kal]] and throwing his body into the ocean. After the revolt, it was also revealed that many of the people who took part in the rebellion were maimed, for example, he ordered that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lull\|Lull]]'s hand and leg were cut off.

By far, his most cruel act was taking [[Kal †\|Kal]]'s best friend, Sara, and turning her into a monstrous cyborg that also acted as the epicentre of the Antimagic field. The machine would constantly electrocute her and force her mind to think and act in specific ways, keeping her in a state of constant fury. 

However, he takes great care of the people of [[Groups & Factions/Luminara\|Luminara]], seeing them as not just ordinary people but worth protecting and exerting effort to help. This was best shown when he turned them into gold to make them easier to protect when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] assaulted the palace. 

#### Intelligence
Malachi has been shown to have an incredibly keen intelligence. The best example of this was when [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] analysed the process he used to turn [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] into gold. It was revealed that Malachi has used alchemy. This was significant because all though powerful wizards of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] believed it was possible to perform alchemy on living matter, none had been able to do it. 

It is also implied that he is responsible for turning Sara into a cyborg, a feat that would be increasingly difficult for the professors at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. 

### Relationships,
#### Kal/ Korrigan
Malachi has a deep hatred towards [[Kal †\|Kal]] because he started the rebellion, which most likely resulted in the death of many Nobles and the loss of a lot of [[Other Information/Money\|money]] for him. 

#### Xekai
Before [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s relationship with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] was revealed, they seemed to be close allies, sharing information and advice and having tea together. 

### History
Not much is known about Malachi before the slave revolt, or how he came into power.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | They all entered the next courtyard, where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] stood atop a balcony overlooking them. His crooked smile emanated evil, and he let down and drew his weapon. The battle was long and complex as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] traded blows with the King of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. Although he wielded a weapon, his magics were much more deadly. Surrounding him throughout the fight was his Aura of Avarice, which caused anyone who entered to have their [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Senses\|senses]] attacked, making them look at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] in awe for his beautiful golden form. Lying a finger on him would hurt them without [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] having to do anything. Despite this, they pushed on, absorbing the waves of deadly attacks and psychic pain.                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] unleashed miniature meteors and powerful spells that struck the king with the force of lightning, targeting his golden visage, which conducted electricity to the detriment of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]'s health. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] thought through the mental anguish and onslaught of attacks from close range, striking weak points at every available opportunity. Aidan used his pact magic to cause his strikes to hit harder and faster than ever. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stood back, letting the spells arc across the battlefield, elegantly dancing from dealing damage to healing and picking their friends up to continue the bloody fight.                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s arrow landed from his bow, hitting their mark accurately. At the same time, others thought of a battle in real space, while [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] also thought of a secondary struggle of wills and ideology between [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] and himself. He stood with the weight of his people's freedom on his shoulders. He ran with the cries of his friends as they were slaughtered mercilessly for a regime that could not hear their pleas. And nooked each arrow for every person who died of starvation, or had been whipped for trying to breathe or those that had gone to bed knowing they would not wake up when dawn broke. All of it was theirs, and all his might, [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Skills\|skills]], and knowledge were leveraged in this battle to free the slaves of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | As the fight waged on, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]'s rage became increasingly rapid, and he resorted to cruel methods to beat his old enemy. At one point, he even ripped his golden arm away from his shoulder to stop [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] from using it to hurt him even more. Roaring in pain, he set his eyes on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], goading him to come closer. The battle continued, and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] did not fall for the king's provocation. Soon, Slyva landed the final blow, and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]'s body crumpled to the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | There was a brief pause as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] watched [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]'s corpse on the ground, almost not believing he was dead. Their unsceretained was proven correct when the king's body began to glow a brilliant golden light. Light got brighter and brighter before vanishing; its place was a Golden Golem that stood before all of them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]'s body was missing as the Golem began to charge up its next attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | The power began to corrupt [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s body as the flesh on his arm began to decay and fall off, revealing rapidly, bone and tendon. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] whispered to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] with grim neutrality, explaining that mortals were never meant to wield such power. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] knew his time was limited, so he rushed towards [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]'s golden golem and launched the word like a spear. It flew through the air with a cackle of laughter and power. Upon making contact, it exploded, throwing [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] back into a wall, but completely decimating the golem.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | Everything fell deathly silent. It was done. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] had been defeated, but at what cost?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] entered the court stand on a balcony above everyone's heads as their screams continued. His eyes surveyed the crowd, and he seemed calmed by his presence. His eyes meandered until they locked with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s. His disdain was evident even from a distance. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s face twisted into a mischievous smile as he mockingly greeted the king. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] returned the smirk, saying, "I wondered when you'd be back"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | He then raised his golden arm to the Nobel crowd, and a brilliant golden light shot from his palm, turning everyone in the crowd to gold. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] explained that he refused to let his people get hurt again. Holding his gaze on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], he smirked before saying, "I do have a surprise for you, though..."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | "You know what? I'm not into Mad Kings. I'm sorry. It's not my style. I do like playing catch, though. And he shoots an arrow," replied [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], and quickly drew his bow and fired an arrow square at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]]. He did not react to the arrow's feel on his golden skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | With a click of his fingers, a pair of side doors swung open as Sara's hulking, golden form entered the courtyard. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] froze, his jaw gaping, as a singular tear ran over his cheek. Another then followed. His legs gave out as he fell to the floor, unable to hold back the torrent of tears and emotions. Satisfied, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] turned on the spot and returned inside the palace, the doors clanging shut behind him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slowly awoke to find themselves in an exquisite room filled with gold and brilliant white marble furnishings. The room was filled with incredibly lifelike statues of people in various states of fear, tears, and pain. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] commented on how little taste [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] has. However, no words left their mouths. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] found the same was true for them. They both looked down, and to their horror, their bodies, up to their eyes, were made completely out of gold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | Before the two could even begin to panic, a grand door opened, and two figures walked in. One was covered in his usual robes, which [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had recognised instantly, and the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|other]] bore the crown of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. A flicker of hope crossed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s eyes as they recognised [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] replied with an enthralled smile, excitedly pointing to some of his new favourites in the collection. He gestured at a few, including Slyva, who seemed to have a defiant look on her face. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to use the [[Admin/Spells/Dispel Magic\|dispel magic]] spell by subtly spelling it; however, the antimagic field appeared already active. In fact, from their vantage point, it seemed like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] was actively trying to ignore them, whether he could hear them or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It was, too, made of solid gold. Malchai poured him a cup of tea. Genturing to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], he explained that they were the most recent ones; he caught them a few hours ago messing with Sara.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly realised that while the antimagic field was active, it hadn't been for long enough to be at full power, allowing them to use the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] spell. They tried to [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], but still refused to reply or even react [^1]. The two talked about a range of topics around politics until the topic eventually turned to the rebellion, where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] said, "We'll have to quell this rebellion as soon as possible. I recommend sending all your guards straight into the quarters." [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] nodded in approval, and once they finished their team, they began leaving the room.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] stopped in his tracks, the air around him becoming very tense. He turned to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and asked, "How does the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] know your name?" The silence was deafening in the room before it was broken with a long, exasperated sigh from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. Before anyone could react, he turned on the spot and punched [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] in the stomach. The force was enough to make the king vomit before passing out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Suddenly, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|a man in ornate clothes]] and a decorated crown entered the room, cackling wildly. He ordered a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] to pick up the half-alive [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]]. He looked at his machine, saying, "It's alright, my pet. You put up a good fight." he then turned to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] "Well, you tried, and that's all we can hope for." And with a cruel laugh, he punched [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] unconscious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They kept walking forward, ready to make their message clear: **The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|king]] would die today.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Upon reading this, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] lets out a guttural scream of rage as all his memories finally returned with the sensation of a white hot blade being stabbed into his mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | We tried every single peaceful thing. By 17, we were seen as a symbol of hope. We operated out of a pub, secretly running underneath my father's forge. We called it the Ember's Refuge. That's where I was heading down towards the day yesterday. But soon after my 18th birthday, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] the King ordered our execution. We did nothing aggressive. We didn't, you know, we weren't planning attacks. It was all peaceful. Broke into our houses and slaughtered some of the resistance. He slaughtered Alandra in front of me and my father.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
