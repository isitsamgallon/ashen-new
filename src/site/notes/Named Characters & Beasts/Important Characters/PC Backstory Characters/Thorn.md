| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]]      | The King ordered purges of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] to purge out the weak. Later in my adolescence, I found purpose alongside a group of close friends: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Thorn\|Thorn]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Kael †\|Kael †]], and my mentor, Alandra. We were trying to find ways to make it better for us. We started crafting propaganda, a book. We tried every single peaceful option to end slavery here. We even had a petition with half of the names of the people in the slum, saying that if we were given freedom and a small wage, we would stay and do our jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]     | Fire licked at the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] 's feet as they regained consciousness, bound tightly to a cross surrounded by all the people he had run from for years. His friends dangled upside down around them, bound and gagged, watching the events unfold - unable to help. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't recognise laughs bitterly in the face of their Father, brother and previous employer. "You know this won't work." They chided as they gestured their bound hands towards the fire snaking around their ankles. Arwen simply did not care as he watched the leaders of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] dangle at his mercy. He informed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|goblin mafia]] would take over their precious [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] when they died by his hand. His eyes dragged themself over his previous employee, the object of his obsession and then vehement hatred, restrained in front of him. "One thing I have found after years of trying to find you, that little taste of catching you and you evading my grip once again, I no longer care about you." Those words hung like a man at the gallows as the slimy nightclub owner retreated, leaving the Thornewood family reunion to commence. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | They are now confronted with a long corridor that holds several swinging blades, arcing at waist height. Korrigan is a feat of athleticism crawly under each of them incredibly quickly, emerging the other side unharmed. Chenris also manages to crawl through and discovers some leavers which slow the swing blades significantly. Mordecai is small enough in his dog form to walk under unharmed. Aiden, the more dexterous of the group manages to easily leap over the blades. However, he doesn't properly check if he has cleared the blade before standing up and gets sliced across his back, and due to the mummy rot curse, he is unable to heal the wound. Finally, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] is able to clear the first blade before being cut down by the second. In a stroke of ingenuity, Korrigan uses [Thorn Whip]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thorn-whip) to lasso her foot and pull her body over to them so they can heal her with a potion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | "That sure is a shame, but it does seem like your protection does little good doesn't it?" and leaves. He returns to reality and assesses the situation. He finds covered in blood with the bodies of around 20 [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] scattered headless around the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. Mordecai confront him, shouting and screaming that this blood is on both of their hands. all he needed to do is burn that stupid note. Korrigan perks up when he hears this and asks to see the note. Chenis laments and pulls out [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]], now covered in blood, burns and fraying at the edges and explains the significance of the note. Halfway through the explanation Korrigan interrupts and uses Thorn Whip to steal the note from chenris. Before anyone can do anything Korrigan has his bow and starts to aim at the note, intending to destroy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 13\|Session 13]] | Chenris is quick to enter his trance state while the others stay awake, conflicted with the sudden change of events. They complain about chenris recent behaviour, alarmed that he has been getting worse and worse with his disrespect and insatiable drive for knowledge that has gotten them in difficult situations a few times. They decide to explore the house and eventually find a small library in one of the rooms. Mordecai and Korrigan are perusing the books before their eye widens in shock. There was a book on the shelf named “Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly” which was written by Kal, Sera and Thorn. Mordecai vaguely remembered the name  Sera from the black ritual and Korrigan was familiar with his old name of Kal. They excitedly brought it back to the group as they showed everyone. Korrigan was especially excited as this was an actual link to his past that could help him with his mission in Lost Haven. After some time, their exhaustion got the better of them and they went to bed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
