| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]] | The King ordered purges of the slums to purge out the weak. Later in my adolescence, I found purpose alongside a group of close friends: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Thorn\|Thorn]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Kael †\|Kael †]], and my mentor, Alandra. We were trying to find ways to make it better for us. We started crafting propaganda, a book. We tried every single peaceful option to end slavery here. We even had a petition with half of the names of the people in the slum, saying that if we were given freedom and a small wage, we would stay and do our jobs. |
