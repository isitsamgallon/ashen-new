| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Kerrigan confirmed this, saying that her name, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]], was one of the few people he remembered after his new role. He then explained that his new goal was to head up to [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] with his party, and she was more than welcome to join them, saying it would be like old times. Sylvia agreed to join them, stating that [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was known for polluting a lot, and it would be good to stop that by killing the king and killing everyone involved in destroying the environment. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | The two big Rizzmeisters (Korrigan and Mordecai) drag Drache to the temple to ask for her help in fixing him. Seraphina says that it interferes too much for her to do so but fixes Mordecais killer hangover. Korrigan then remembers the celestial phrase that Terrance Witherfeather used when he freed Korrigan from the ivory Crest years ago and found that it kinda put Drache into stasis.                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]]      | Kal placed a worn out short sword offering it to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]] and stepped back, tears littering his face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]]      | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]] called out for Kal's help, urging him to open his eyes and help her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
