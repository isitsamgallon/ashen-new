| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]              | The King ordered purges of [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Slums\|the slums]] to purge out the weak. Later in my adolescence, I found purpose alongside a group of close friends: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Thorn\|Thorn]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Kael †\|Kael †]], and my mentor, Alandra. We were trying to find ways to make it better for us. We started crafting propaganda, a book. We tried every single peaceful option to end slavery here. We even had a petition with half of the names of the people in the slum, saying that if we were given freedom and a small wage, we would stay and do our jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Kerrigan confirmed this, saying that her name, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera\|Sera]], was one of the few people he remembered after his new role. He then explained that his new goal was to head up to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] with his party, and she was more than welcome to join them, saying it would be like old times. Sylvia agreed to join them, stating that [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was known for polluting a lot, and it would be good to stop that by killing the king and killing everyone involved in destroying the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The room was quiet for a moment before korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had met any [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]'s, to which the headmaster said he had met the [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]]s but none of the others. When asked, the headmaster also explained that he and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] managed to stay alive for as long as they did because of forbidden magics, but would elaborate any further as they were forbidden after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | Mordecai laughs before saying that she needs to make sure that he does nothing stupid while they're gone, and she agrees. He finishes his spell and awkwardly leaves the room as he doesn't quite know how to end the conversation. Outside, Chenris and Korrigan are waiting, Chenris is rereading some of his research notes with a glum expression. Korrigan is looking in a nearby mirror, furiously trying to wipe away his "Duel Breaker" mark, but is unable to have any effect. They try examining the mark and have no idea how to get rid of it. Mordecai suggests finding a temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to see if she can remove it, as it might be a curse. In the meantime, Chenris suggest that Korrigan gets into wearing hats as Mordecai gets out his colour pallet and foundation colours and suggests they use makeup to cover it up for now. Korrigan says this ok as long as "You don't make me do red-face". Mordecai does their best, and most of the writing is mostly covered but is still slightly visible. Mordecai [Messages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) Chenris, saying that he is not to tell Korrigan how bad it looks. Chenris agrees.                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s purple portal opens just outside of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], and off in the distance they can see [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] drawing in the mud with a stick as he waits for them. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | Aidan had decided to not separate from the group and go to the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to cure his Mummy Rot. Having received his healing he felt more powerful than ever and felt that if he raised his hands at that very moment, then something big would happen. As he did so the world around him slowed to a halt, as a cruel God's laughter could be heard echoing in his head. No matter what he tried, time was stuck in this state of sinful silence. With little else to do, he began to wonder. The once familiar and vibrant world around him was now a shadow of itself, cold and unmoving. Eventually, he found his way to the wear the party had left the horse and carriage and moved them to a safe place in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] then wondered to what he hoped was [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]]. When all was said and done, Aidan had spent nearly a week wondering this wasteland alone desperate to hear anything that wasn't the laughter of his cruel patron. Eventually, he found the fort where he discovered Korrigan stuck motionless on the path. As he looked upon his party member, the world slowly started to spin again as time resumed its march forward.                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | During the fight, korrigan's arm starts to get itch for an unknown reason. Additionally Aidan, is hit with the Mummies "Rotting Fist" ability, leading to his maximum health being lowered and an inability to heal. Chenris investigates and learns that Lesser restoration is not enough to cure this curse, and suggests taking him to [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] but isn't sure if she will be willing to heal him due to his appeared alliance with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | The temple is huge and made of white marble with magical crystals and bubbles floating around the large building. There is a small town located around the temple. Inside there are people in similar white robes likes in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]]. Before going in, Chenris pulls Mordecai aside and tells him not to mention their involvement with the gods this time, since he would like to look around. Mordecai sheepishly agrees to stay quiet. Chenris talks to the receptionist and pretends not to know who the all-father is. The receptionist is very accommodating and would love to answer questions about the gods. In this temple, they worship all of the Gods, especially [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Curious, Korrigan asks about their opinions on the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s. They say they like the heralds of gods who are seen as peace-loving and kind like [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] however, the heralds associated with gods like [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] often come to death's destruction so they would be hesitant to invite this in.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Chenris enquires about his opinions on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. The priest explains he was not a fan of the huge lose of life that the event caused. The priest elaborates, saying every God has their fanatics and extremists. Even the worshipers of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] have been known to use her name in vain and commit atrocities. Fortunately. There are moderates for every faith, including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. For example, the extremists believe that [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to come take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction. The moderates of the faction believe [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. The priest gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the humans, the Dwarves were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The humans, led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the OFC, there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the OFC is a pillar of freedom and equality. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 13\|Session 13]]          | Chenris is quick to enter his trance state while the others stay awake, conflicted with the sudden change of events. They complain about chenris recent behaviour, alarmed that he has been getting worse and worse with his disrespect and insatiable drive for knowledge that has gotten them in difficult situations a few times. They decide to explore the house and eventually find a small library in one of the rooms. Mordecai and Korrigan are perusing the books before their eye widens in shock. There was a book on the shelf named “Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly” which was written by Kal, Sera and Thorn. Mordecai vaguely remembered the name  Sera from the black ritual and Korrigan was familiar with his old name of Kal. They excitedly brought it back to the group as they showed everyone. Korrigan was especially excited as this was an actual link to his past that could help him with his mission in Lost Haven. After some time, their exhaustion got the better of them and they went to bed.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | The two big Rizzmeisters (Korrigan and Mordecai) drag Drache to the temple to ask for her help in fixing him. Seraphina says that it interferes too much for her to do so but fixes Mordecais killer hangover. Korrigan then remembers the celestial phrase that Terrance Witherfeather used when he freed Korrigan from the ivory Crest years ago and found that it kinda put Drache into stasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
