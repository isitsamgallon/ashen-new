| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Drache explains his plan: There is a secret tunnel through the mountain that leads straight into Tulan that nobody knows about. They go in the dead of night to make sure they're not spotted by the many guards that live in the fort. He has a friend on the inside, named [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]], who can help them in and give them disguises to make them less conspicuous when exploring the fort. Despite all of their precautions, he warns that things could get messy or chaotic so everyone needs to be on the top of their game for this mission. Korrigan mentions he could cast Pass Without Trace to help the stealth-inclined party members sneak through unnoticed. It's at this point the ranger realises he can take off the muzzle, and does so sighting he'll need it off for spell casting. Drache makes one final confession, He was able to make contact by bribing a supply delivery to pass some notes into the fort but hasn't received any confirmation from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] that the plan is happening since he is unable to respond. This also means [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] might not know they're coming but Drache has complete trust in both of them so not to worry.                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | He slowly enters the tunnel, explaining that this is where he told his friend to meet him. He lit a torch to illuminate the tunnel and ventured deeper. Everyone but Drache was on edge as each of their footsteps vibrated off the impossibly smooth walls of the passageway. They had been walking for some time when they saw a light off into the distance, companied by the squeaking of carriage wheels carrying a heavy load. Drache rushes up to greet his old friend, with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] opening his arms to welcome a large bear hug from his [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] friend. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] is a half-orc wearing the purple armour of the Tulan Fort, his body and face were covered in painful-looking scars. He almost cried for joy saying, "It's really you stumpy!". Behind him was a small cart with large sacks on it, which the half-orc started to unload as the two caught up. He apologised to Drache that he was unable to respond to his letters as one was found and burnt leading to him being put on low rations for 2 weeks as punishment. Drache apologises, but the half-orc will have none of it stating that it's all for a good cause.                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Soon the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] catches up and asks what's going on. Drache introduces the man as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]], his best friend in the fort before he left. They also explain that they call Drache Stumpy because he is one of the smallest in the fort. Everyone found this incredibly hard to believe with how their friend is - easily towering over most of the people they've met on their journey so far. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] then notices Drache's missing leg and states it will be quite a shock to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] but he's sure that won't matter in the end. Mordecai asks what types of people typically work at the fort so he could start working on a disguise. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] explains that there are a lot of half-orcs and many of the other races. "They ain't too picky as long as you can fight and will obey [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|the boss]]" explains [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]]. Drache admits they don't treat people well at Tulan, unlike in [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. Mordecai explains that he has some spells that he can use to disguise himself, the half-orc laughs stating he'll need to put on a lot of muscle to fit in around the fort.                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | He then opens the bags from the cart to reveal a few sets of worn and quite gross Tulan armour. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] had stolen them from the laundry room, finding it funny that there would be a few Fort members walking around naked for a while. Mordecai is repulsed by the armour and uses [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2213-prestidigitation) to clean some of the armour up, at least so it doesn't stink off Orc sweat. Now that the whole party was in the light of a torch he started to laugh at how scrawny they were, wondering why Drache would hang out with them. Drache jumps to their defence stating that they're strong in other ways and (mostly) good people. Everyone starts to put on the armour own, Drache fits well into it but it's a bit big for the rest, it's one size fits all so they would have to make do with what they had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | As they inch closer to the Tulan entrance, the number of cobwebs and debris increases until they are confronted with a grand arch housing a false wooden back, presumably another cupboard. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] asks how long the tunnels have been around, but Drache has no idea, they existed before he or Damascus arrived, with the fort leader arriving some 20 years ago. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] states that if they have any last-minute preparations to make then do them now. He has to go on ahead so people don't get suspicious. Before he leaves Drache asks if much has changed since he left. The half-orc glumly tells him most things haven't changed, Klyn has gone mad and even sided with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the war]], so people are losing faith in his leadership fast. Drache promises to repay the favour, but the orc will have none of it and opens the false backing, disappearing into the fort. Korrigan takes this time to cast Pass Without Trace while Mordecai uses [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619102-disguise-self) to change his appearance to match an extremely buff half-orc, Drache gives him a flirty wink. |
