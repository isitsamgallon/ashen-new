### Overview
She is [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]]'s lover from [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. When they first met, Drache was a part of [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and would sneak out, abandoning post sometimes, to go see her. 

### Notable Information
- For a long time not much was known about her until Drache talked with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] and learned that she was last spotted heading for Tulan, not aware he was in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] at the time.
- In [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]], Drache was finally able to free her from Tulan by sneaking into the fort at night. They found her hung upside down in a torture room, beaten and bloodied. 
- Although she had been tortured for possibly a long time, she still had her old sarcastic humour and seemed to be in high spirits. She was shackled with magical cuffs, that required a key to open them so the party left to find the key and free her. However, along the way [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|Vormomli Bronzehand]], were spotted heading to the torture chamber and discussing how they wanted to kill her. 
- They sent [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] to investigate but lost contact with the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] soon after and entered themselves to find both Mordecai and Emmeline unconscious on the floor and Klyn waiting for a duel. After a long drawn-out battle, Drache managed to beat his old boss and save both of them.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]         | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wanted to join as he reasoned that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] was fighting them for a reason but didn't want to kill everyone. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if Sylvia had ever run into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], but she had no clue who that was. Hlafbie revealed they thought every woman knew every other woman. They quickly explained that their mother knew everyone in their home town when Sylia glared at them for such a sexist remark. However, when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] came to mention their home town, their voice trailed off as they realised they did not know where this was [^5]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | Drache ripped [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] emblem from this shirt, kissing it and determined that he would find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|who went missing]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
