### Overview
She is [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]]'s lover from [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. When they first met, Drache was a part of [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and would sneak out, abandoning post sometimes, to go see her. 

### Notable Information
- For a long time not much was known about her until Drache talked with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] and learned that she was last spotted heading for Tulan, not aware he was in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] at the time.
- In [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]], Drache was finally able to free her from Tulan by sneaking into the fort at night. They found her hung upside down in a torture room, beaten and bloodied. 
- Although she had been tortured for possibly a long time, she still had her old sarcastic humour and seemed to be in high spirits. She was shackled with magical cuffs, that required a key to open them so the party left to find the key and free her. However, along the way [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|Vormomli Bronzehand]], were spotted heading to the torture chamber and discussing how they wanted to kill her. 
- They sent [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] to investigate but lost contact with the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] soon after and entered themselves to find both Mordecai and Emmeline unconscious on the floor and Klyn waiting for a duel. After a long drawn-out battle, Drache managed to beat his old boss and save both of them.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]]         | Suddenly remembering the opportunity they had, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] inquired about how [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] were doing. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly chimed in with his concern for his girlfriend's safety. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] dismissively assured them that both were fine and currently out roaming the world, helping people. He did stress that they were swamped with work, which was why they hadn't had the time to check in with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]         | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wanted to join as he reasoned that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] was fighting them for a reason but didn't want to kill everyone. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if Sylvia had ever run into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], but she had no clue who that was. Hlafbie revealed they thought every woman knew every other woman. They quickly explained that their mother knew everyone in their home town when Sylia glared at them for such a sexist remark. However, when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] came to mention their home town, their voice trailed off as they realised they did not know where this was [^5].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]         | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suddenly found himself alone in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. He was surrounded by giant mushrooms that resembled trees more than the food he prepared for dinner whenever Chenris misbehaved. The ground was made of thick marsh that seemed to stretch on forever, and after a few confused, aimless steps, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] became stuck in the mud, slowly sinking down into a cold death. He struggled for what felt like hours as the mud consumed him [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]]. First, it took his legs, then his hands, his chest, and his arms, until he was left with nothing but a head on the ground, much like one finds when scavenging a battlefield for scraps and coin. Yet this head screamed for help that would never come. Soon, these screams ceased as the mud took his mouth, filling it with the vile taste of rot and disease. The mud was cold and unfeeling as it robbed the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] of his sense of smell next. When the mud slowly began to fill his ear canals, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had nearly given up and accepted his fate. He was tired, tired of fighting, and just wanted to relax and live a peaceful life with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. As a burning sensation replaced the air in his lungs, his world went dark as he sank through a void that did not care about his plight.                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]     | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] suddenly awoke from a deep sleep, everything felt incredibly wrong. He quickly checked on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], who seemed fine until he realised she wasn't moving, in fact, nothing around him was moving and it was all dead quiet. He quickly jumped out of bed, grabbing his great axe, he ran outside to find everyone was still around but frozen midway through going about their daily lives. There were even birds hovering motionless in the sky. Drache gripped his GreatAxe tightly before focusing his breath and used [Detect Good and Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good) to see if he could figure out what was happening to him. In this heightened state he realised that this was very similar to the feeling of walking through [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] during their fight with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. With that realisation, he had the sudden and urgent need to leave Uvam. He rushes back inside to write a note to Emmeline: "Something is wrong, I have to leave, be safe my love." He stabs the note into the door before donning his armour and leaving [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]     | After the infiltration of [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] took a few days to rest and heal their injuries. Unfortunately, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] 's injuries were much more serious than originally thought, and she wouldn't be able to travel for a while and needed bed rest. Hearing this, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] informs the party that he'll stay behind and make sure she is safe and will catch up with them when she can travel again. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], for his part, left at night, leaving a note explaining he had gone off to investigate something and would join the party later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] was desperate to leave [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] (and the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]) as soon as possible and urged [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] to pack their belongings quickly so they could leave by the next morning. The morning they set to leave, Mordecai has a quick conversation with Emmeline. They use [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds) to help her healing speed up and say, "Drache is quite possibly one of the last genuinely good men in this world, and if anything were to happen to him, then I have no idea what we could do. Please keep him safe while we're gone"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | They discover that the name "Yakawa" refers to a temple at the top of the mountain, there is then a town surrounding it where people and pilgrims live or rest. The town is built on the mountain edge breaking the town into tiers going up the surface of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] with the shrine at the highest point. The town surrounding the shrine is protected by large palisade walls. It is currently late afternoon, so Drache suggests resting up now so they can sneak into [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] in the dead of night and have a better chance of rescuing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. They go to the Adventures Guild where two [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s are running the reception. Mordecai is unwilling to speak, not wanting to be accidentally noticed by anyone, so Drache is the one to ask for their usual two rooms. But once he is given the rooms, he insists they show him the way - something that is not typically at all, but they relent and awkwardly show them the way. Once shown to their room, Drache suggests having 'an emergency meeting' to discuss their plans. One of the receptionists comments "That's a weird name for a fivesome". Korrigan, forgetting that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was with them, says there are only 4 of them causing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to become mad at him again. She runs off stating that she'll get her own room. Korrigan tries to apologise but it's a lost cause. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | Drache explains his plan: There is a secret tunnel through the mountain that leads straight into Tulan that nobody knows about. They go in the dead of night to make sure they're not spotted by the many guards that live in the fort. He has a friend on the inside, named [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]], who can help them in and give them disguises to make them less conspicuous when exploring the fort. Despite all of their precautions, he warns that things could get messy or chaotic so everyone needs to be on the top of their game for this mission. Korrigan mentions he could cast Pass Without Trace to help the stealth-inclined party members sneak through unnoticed. It's at this point the ranger realises he can take off the muzzle, and does so sighting he'll need it off for spell casting. Drache makes one final confession, He was able to make contact by bribing a supply delivery to pass some notes into the fort but hasn't received any confirmation from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] that the plan is happening since he is unable to respond. This also means [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] might not know they're coming but Drache has complete trust in both of them so not to worry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | Soon the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] catches up and asks what's going on. Drache introduces the man as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]], his best friend in the fort before he left. They also explain that they call Drache Stumpy because he is one of the smallest in the fort. Everyone found this incredibly hard to believe with how their friend is - easily towering over most of the people they've met on their journey so far. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] then notices Drache's missing leg and states it will be quite a shock to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] but he's sure that won't matter in the end. Mordecai asks what types of people typically work at the fort so he could start working on a disguise. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] explains that there are a lot of half-orcs and many of the other races. "They ain't too picky as long as you can fight and will obey [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|the boss]]" explains [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]]. Drache admits they don't treat people well at Tulan, unlike in [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. Mordecai explains that he has some spells that he can use to disguise himself, the half-orc laughs stating he'll need to put on a lot of muscle to fit in around the fort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | They carried on through the next door and reached a room where they didn't even have to open the door to smell the stench of iron and viscera. Opening the door, they were greeted with the forts torture rooms. The various tables, furniture and floors were covered in blood and ripped-out fingernails. A few of the latest victims were still strapped to tables or hung on the wall, and a pile of corpses had been constructed in the corner, ready to be cleaned away. Another wall was lined with prison cells with one holding [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] shackled upside down to the wall covered in blood and gore. Mordecai, in a comforting voice, explains that she needn't worry, they're here to help, his words carrying the power of [Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/healing-word) on them. Barely conscious and not recognising Mordecai's voice, she spat a gruesome mixture of blood, bile and bone at him, exclaiming they'll never take her alive. Seeing his loved one in such a horrifying state, Drache falls into a fit of rage, ripping the cage door off its hinges and throwing it to the side. Practically falling to the floor to meet her face he asks how she's been and he coyly replies, "Oh you know, I've just been hanging around".                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | He begins to try and take her cuffs off but has no luck. Chenris takes a closer look and immediately recognises them as Magical Cuffs, a type of restraint that can be broken by neither magic nor weapons and would require a key. Mordecai and Korrigan start to panic as the thrown door makes a large amount of noise, saying they have to leave soon or they might be caught. Chenris ask [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] if she knows where the key to her restraints is. She says that the torturer often spends the night at the tavern, drinking himself half to death, he'll probably be there. Before they leave, Drache finds a flower and put it in her hair, she responds with "This is the gayest shit I've ever seen", and everyone stifles a laugh before Mordecai says to hang in there. With a sarcastic smile, she says "Don't worry, I've got time. My dinner reservation isn't till 6."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | Just as they're about to head in that direction, Korrigan notices a door starting to creak open and ushers everyone into a bush to hide. Out the door [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|a strong-looking dwarf]] appear talking about how they "Might as well kill that [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]] bitch, She won't give us anything" as they head into the throne room. Drache could not help but feel proud at how resilient his love had been. With [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]'s life on the line, they decide to split up. Korrigan will go grab the key while the rest will try to save [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] if she is in danger. Mordecai gives everyone Bardic Inspiration, while Drache gives Korrigan directions to the fort before they split up for their missions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | By this point, Mordecai has made it to the room to find it unchanged since they last were there. He uses [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) to update the rest of the party on the situation. They decide to wait for Korrigan and the key so they free [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and escape quickly. Drache suggests that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] should keep watch for any patrols and she runs off to keep a look out. Mordecai, while waiting for the key, spends some time comforting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and making her as comfortable as possible, when she looks behind him and screams. Before he can react, the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] is knocked unconscious by a club from behind. Hearing the scream, Drache is about to jump into action before he does Chenris suggests that he should use his reply to Mordecai and find out what happened, after getting no reply they decide it is time they enter the room. Chenris surmises that they will need another healer if they get into a fight and rushes to grab [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | Drache begins to sneak into the room and greets [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and Mordecai unconscious on either side of Damascus' throne, with the man himself seated and bored. The barbarian is instantly spotted, so he just walks in to confront his cruel former boss. As he approaches, he spots out of the corner of his eye, the Dwarf readying a sneak attack. Effortlessly dogging out the way, the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] snarled "You sneaky bastard". "Worth a shot" grumbled the dwarf as Drache explained his respect for the attempt. Witnessing the entire event, Klyn begins to cackle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | As Drache said those would, a crooked smile spread across Damascus' face and he accepts the duel, excited to see another man suffer for defying his orders. He walked to the middle of the room, kicking [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] as he went. This action sent Drache into a rage, like none he had ever experienced. His hands were white hot as drew his great sword it seemed to almost beg him to draw blood and rip limb from limb. Chenris used this time to try and incapacitate the Dwarf but misses, the dwarf raises a transparent wall to make sure they can not interfere with a duel, lest he is branded a duel breaker. Korrigan knows that these types of people value honour and reputation above all else, so would never dream of sullying his reputation by interviewing in an official duel. This helped calm the rest of their nerves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You don't either. We will find each other again in this life, or the next" Drache says as his mind races to come up with a solution that does not exist. Once again Korrigan heals the man, saying, "Stand up my friend, don't take defeat so easily". Drache rises again, mustering his courage to swing his sword one last time. Just as he is about to swing the blade, Drache's vision is covered in blood and brain matter, as the dwarf fires a crossbow point-blank to the back of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]]' head, killing the man instantly. "I've had quite enough of all you bullshit Klyn. Now you all should leave while you have the chance" growled the dwarf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Chenris gives him and an old staff to use as a crutch.
