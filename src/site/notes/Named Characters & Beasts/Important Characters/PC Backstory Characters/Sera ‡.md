| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]]          | The King ordered purges of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] to purge out the weak. Later in my adolescence, I found purpose alongside a group of close friends: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Thorn\|Thorn]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Kael †\|Kael †]], and my mentor, Alandra. We were trying to find ways to make it better for us. We started crafting propaganda, a book. We tried every single peaceful option to end slavery here. We even had a petition with half of the names of the people in the slum, saying that if we were given freedom and a small wage, we would stay and do our jobs. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]         | Kerrigan confirmed this, saying that her name, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]], was one of the few people he remembered after his new role. He then explained that his new goal was to head up to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] with his party, and she was more than welcome to join them, saying it would be like old times. Sylvia agreed to join them, stating that [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was known for polluting a lot, and it would be good to stop that by killing the king and killing everyone involved in destroying the environment.                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | Kal placed a worn out short sword offering it to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]] and stepped back, tears littering his face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]] called out for Kal's help, urging him to open his eyes and help her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
