#INFORMATION_MISSING_OR_OUT-OF-DATE 
### Overview
She seems to be an old friend of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]]. Not much is known about her apart from when she was mentioned during [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]] and wrote a [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly\|Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly]] with Korrigan and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Thorn\|Thorn]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]         | Passing the cave was a ginormous robot constructed entirely out of gold. On top of it was a red [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|tiefling]], which seemed hardwired into the robot as if its bottom half had been cut off and fused with the machine. The [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|tiefling]]'s eyes were filled with rage. The robot's legs alone must have been 4 or 5 [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s tall, and it seemed to be powered by one of the tower crystals, with one glowing brilliantly in the centre of the robot's chest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]         | Seeing the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|tiefling]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they could reason with it. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] nodded and said he would hold back with the bow and shoot the crystal in the middle if [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could convince them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nodded, quickly climbed into the cave, and began to play their song about the revolution. Notably, the song mentioned the salve [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]] quite a lot. Upon hearing them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|she]] quickly snapped her metal body towards [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] before lunging at them. She began screaming, "[[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]]! They killed my [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]]!"                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]         | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] fived out of the way, screaming that their friend was safe but needed their help. They both realised this must have been one of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s childhood friends. The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|tiefling]] screams that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is lying. To convince her, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] shouts, "You gave him a sword and he was going to kill the king with it!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]         | The robot seems to falter momentarily as tears run down the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|tiefling]] 's face. In the moment of pause before the machine's fists come thundering down, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sends them flying to heap on the ground. The machine flares again for a metal voice screams, "i will kill you, i will kill you" However, in the background, a more [[human\|human]] voice could be heard pleading for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to turn away. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly recovers and dives between the robot's legs and takes the chance to gather their soundings. On the other side of the room, they spot a wooden door that seems to be another entrance back into the palace. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] decided their best chance was to get to the door and hope something on the other side could help them. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]         | Back in the old food store, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] observed from above. He held off from shooting the crystal because it seemed for a moment that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] would be able to reach the monster. As he watched, he began reading the magic in the area. "No.. it couldn't be," he said, as he realised that an antimagic field was coming from the robot itself. Deep within his body, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] weled with compassion for the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|tiefling]]; however, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] pushed that to the side and, with a clinical neutrality, he nooked an arrow on the bow and fired at the crystal, aiming to destroy it.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]         | The machine blames them again before shackling [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|the tiefling]] on top as they scream in pain and anger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]         | The King ordered purges of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] to purge out the weak. Later in my adolescence, I found purpose alongside a group of close friends: [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Thorn\|Thorn]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Kael †\|Kael †]], and my mentor, Alandra. We were trying to find ways to make it better for us. We started crafting propaganda, a book. We tried every single peaceful option to end slavery here. We even had a petition with half of the names of the people in the slum, saying that if we were given freedom and a small wage, we would stay and do our jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]         | Kerrigan confirmed this, saying that her name, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]], was one of the few people he remembered after his new role. He then explained that his new goal was to head up to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] with his party, and she was more than welcome to join them, saying it would be like old times. Sylvia agreed to join them, stating that [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was known for polluting a lot, and it would be good to stop that by killing the king and killing everyone involved in destroying the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | Kal placed a worn out short sword offering it to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]] and stepped back, tears littering his face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]] called out for Kal's help, urging him to open his eyes and help her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
