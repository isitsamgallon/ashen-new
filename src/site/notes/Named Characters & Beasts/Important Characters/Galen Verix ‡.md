### Overview
Galen Verix is the current Emperor of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], currently residing in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], in a massive palace and a known [[Other Information/Perpetual\|Perpetual]]. He is a distant relative of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] and like many people in The Dawn, has a particular hatred for [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] due to the ongoing tensions with [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. However, if proper etiquette is followed he can show some patience. 

He is particularly renowned as an impressive fighter who fought during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] as leader of one of the main factions in [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]]. This has led to an almost obsessive personality when it comes to stopping any future attempts to bring the Gods and, more importantly, [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] down to [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was also revealed that he was incredibly in love with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]], an affection that was not returned, much to his dismay. 

### Personality
When the party first met Galen, he was a mean, vindictive and incredibly racist man who did not seem to care about the welfare of his citizens or his people as long as he got what he wanted. At times he often came across as obsessive, fixating on blind loyalty and the preservation of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]].

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] greets them there and warns them not to bullshit anything and Chenris does all the appropriate etiquette things because turns out he was a Nobel this entire time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], initially suggested that the people of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] could leave and find another place to call home, however, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] hated this idea due to potential uprising that could happen in the future - which he absolutely couldn't allow. After some pondering, Chenris suggested that using The Emperor’s propaganda team to make the emperor sound merciful like here cares for the people of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Suggesting that they could say that [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] might have plans to invade the area due to it strategic importance in war. The emperor could then move these people to location that he has better ability to control/ gather Intel on the people. He seemed pleased with this idea and allowed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to leave, saying his people would be in touch. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | We meet [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's Dad and he is a raging arsehole. He is very dismissive and hatful towards Steve and is even unaware of what he has been doing for the last few years, thinking Steve is still in his room after all this time. The party scam the nobel into giving them gold to check on Steve. They venture to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's old room & find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] wanting to talk to them, teasing them about how doesn't know who he is and then disappears into another portal, after telling them that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] wants to see them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
