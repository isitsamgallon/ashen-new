### Overview
Galen Verix is the current Emperor of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], currently residing in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], in a massive palace and a known [[Other Information/Perpetual\|Perpetual]]. He is a distant relative of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] and like many people in The Dawn, has a particular hatred for [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] due to the ongoing tensions with [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. However, if proper etiquette is followed he can show some patience. 

He is particularly renowned as an impressive fighter who fought during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] as leader of one of the main factions in [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]]. This has led to an almost obsessive personality when it comes to stopping any future attempts to bring the Gods and, more importantly, [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] down to [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was also revealed that he was incredibly in love with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]], an affection that was not returned, much to his dismay. 

### Personality
When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] first met Galen, he was a mean, vindictive and incredibly racist man who did not seem to care about the welfare of his citizens or his people as long as he got what he wanted. At times he often came across as obsessive, fixating on blind loyalty and the preservation of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | Once they had determined that the fiery display had ceased, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] crawled back through his trusty crack in the wall and witnessed the secret meeting in its entirety. Once the older man was convinced that the eavesdroppers had been vanquished, he spoke once again, announcing that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|the Emperor]] had “betrayed and abandoned” them. He encouraged the crowd to resurrect the priesthood and bring back their saviour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are getting ready to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] decides it would be best for him to scout the area out ahead of time and to meet him in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] when they can make it. The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Suddenly a purple flame appears in the hand of a man wearing a black mask illuminating him in the dark to the party. Korrigan instantly greets him "Hi [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]!" But the masked figure has no idea who that is and simply asks if they are aware that they are trespassing in the palace of Dawnhaven. Mordecai accuses them of doing the exact same thing. Before the man replies, he clicks his fingers and behind him, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] appears kneels by his side and calls the masked man Master. Korrigan can quickly tell that something is controlling him. The man says that they have no idea what he is doing, for all they know, he is trying to save Dawnhaven for the world. Mordecai attempts to cast [[Admin/Spells/Dispel Magic\|Dispel Magic]] but it fails instantly. The man pats Galen on the head and tells him to go back to bed, Galen immediately walks back to bed in a daze.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | Korrigan pulls out the map and asks where they should be going. Chenris suggest going to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and stopping by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to see what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Korrigan suggests we also go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] since it's on the way to Dawnhaven. Mordecai asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] if she has anywhere she wants to go, but she says she doesn't have anywhere she specifically wants to go, but she should probably return to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] soon, her people probably already think she's dead or kidnapped, although she mentions that she wants to see [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] before going home. Fearing the worst, Mordecai asks how they would pick a new emperor. She explains that one of the lords would be elected into power but that it would take at least 30 years to pick a new ruler, Chenris is surprised, asking, "That quickly?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decide to go [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]] as it is nearby and might have a place for them to stay the night. Chenris also comments how quite it was when they walk past earlier so it would be good to learn what happened and possibly even find out what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. They head out and just as they are crossing the bridge, they see a carriage and horse stranded by the roadside, they can also see that the driver had been murdered with most of the cargo being stolen. Assuming it's the guy who was hiding in the bush earlier that day, they scope out the area to make sure he isn't nearby. Aidan suggests taking the cart and Korrigan wants to befriend the horse and it seems to like him. They decide that taking the horse and carriage will make it easier to travel and could give people a chance to rest. Chenris sits in the carriage to read  exclaiming how nice it is to since he cant read and walk. Mordecai also sits and take the time to tunes his instruments. They make good time and arrive at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]] just as the sun is setting. |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]]          | In Elvish Chenris and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhear the city guards taking a newspaper article about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|The Emperor]] having gone missing since [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|his war with the OFC]] and that local lords have started taking more land/ control than they normally would leading to a lot of panic. Reportedly [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] is fine and hasn't suffered any loss or control. Mordecai, not understanding any of this, asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] and mentions that Chenris has been trying to translate an [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|old book]] and get the full story but has been struggling with the last few chapters. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] asks to see it and instantly reads the title of the book out in Ancient Dwarfish and then again in Common. Mordecai asks if she can translate it and she does just that.                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], initially suggested that the people of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] could leave and find another place to call home, however, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] hated this idea due to potential uprising that could happen in the future - which he absolutely couldn't allow. After some pondering, Chenris suggested that using [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|The Emperor]]’s propaganda team to make [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|the emperor]] sound merciful like here cares for the people of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Suggesting that they could say that [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] might have plans to invade the area due to it strategic importance in war.
