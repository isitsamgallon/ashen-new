| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]    | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly asked if they could be fixed as Tereance got up and placed a huge book on his bookshelf, as he muttered to himself, which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was unable to hear. Instead, they had a look at the book the wizard was reading from. Although they didn't recognise it, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] instantly recognised it as a [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] reference book. It was an ancient one that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] himself wrote while still lecturing. The martial arts cover was incredibly advanced, so much so that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] hadn't managed to study and understand the foundational concepts that were used in the book. The elf was practically salivating at the sight of such a book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]    | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pointed out that they had actually met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], explaining that it was as strange an experience as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] had cast a spell on [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], leading them to meet the other soul in their body. Terenace laughed and explained that was actually the spell they were going to cast, and asked [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would like ot meet the soul again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]]    | Next was [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] Heleyarus, who walked in with a sour-looking plaster on his face. He wasn't pleased that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], of all people, was using such a powerful relic in a quick [[Other Information/Money\|money]]-making scheme. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] blamed the whole thing on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] but explained he wasn't going to argue with the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]]    | With a click of his fingers, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] created a magnetic bubble that forced everyone to manifest as the bodies they truly were. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood next to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow, a ghost apparition of [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] appeared next to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stood side-by-side. With a perfected headmaster's gaze, he questioned [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] on their actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]]    | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] saw nothing wrong with how they were using the book and pointed out that, as a researcher, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]] should be well aware of the pain of trying to undo one's research and know that many would accept [[Other Information/Money\|money]] from strange places if it meant the research could continue. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir]]'s eye twitched as he couldnot or would not refute the artguement, he simply truned on his heal and left the room, ending the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]] | Before they could say anything else, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] cleared his throat with a commanding cough before claiming that it seemed that the spell didn't work for everyone and that there was one more person who wasn't telling the full truth. As he said this, his eyes narrowed to the back of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Following the headmaster's gaze, they found him staring at [[[[Obeus Yelris\|[[Obeus Yelris]] Yelris]], who looked to be on the verge of tears. With a click of his fingers, she let out a scream, she lost all the strength in her legs and crumpled to the floor. As she did so, it looked like a spectral being was being yanked from her. The being crumpled on the floor was small and bony[^2] but wore the same golden mask as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. "Ah, an [[Named Characters & Beasts/Aspect of Ebis Daro\|Aspect of Ebis Daro]], I presume", reasoned the headmaster. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' eyes narrowed in anger at the Empress, but before anyone could say anything, the aspect stood up and began readying a spell. |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]] | The headmaster suddenly spoke up looking dismayed at the chaos his office was now in after the fight. He asked if they had any more questions for him as he was a very busy man and had a lot of work to do. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asked if had any advice on what they do next. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] snorted and exclaimed that despite his position in a school, he did not teach and therefore didn't care what they did after they left his room. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] snorted at the back of the group but refused to look the headmaster in the eye. The headmaster msued while stroke his beared before telling them to leave if they have nothing else to do or say. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to argue that he let them in to ask question so it seems odd he doesn't care to help them with their next steps.                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | After some talking, it was revealed that the [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] used to do a lot of research on [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]], specifically [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] before they were kicked out of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] for causing too much hassle for the guards and priests. Most of their research had been taken or was locked away by the university, so the engineers couldn't be of much help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then asked if it was possible to see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], the headmaster, reasoning that he must know something about this research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | Sitting at the desk was a powerful elf that glowed with golden magical power. his voice boomed with power and importance, and he asked how he could help[^6]. Something within [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew that this wasn't the real [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], but they didn't say anything allowed. Mordecai got right into it and asked about [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Haldir mused for a moment before explaining that he remembered [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] being built and revealed that he even knew [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]], although he admitted that he didn't know them well and had only chatted with them casually a few times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | Korrigan asked if he knew of any other way of keeping the gods at bay. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] revealed that the only thing that could work would be a steady stream of influential people being sacrificed at [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], just like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]'s surface. It would be the only way to keep the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]] active without having to use [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] knew someone cackled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | The headmaster went silent for a moment before revealing that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] used to be a lecturer at [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] before being thrown out for being a shapeshifter and his fanatical worship of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] (Sacrificing students). The headteacher explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] was trying to make his own [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army with all the sacrifices he was making. However, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] refused to elaborate beyond this. instead, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] asked about the crystals and making more towers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | The room was quiet for a moment before korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had met any [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]'s, to which the headmaster said he had met the [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]]s but none of the others. When asked, the headmaster also explained that he and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] managed to stay alive for as long as they did because of forbidden magics, but would elaborate any further as they were forbidden after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | Coming to the end of their questions, Korrigan asked how many towers were needed to keep the gods at bay, especially with a lot of them falling. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] explained that only one is needed to stop them from entering the world, but with each one falling, people who gain power from the gods would grow stronger. Then the headmaster gave a warning that before long, all of them would fall, including [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] tower, it was not safe as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] already knew where it was. But before they could ask how he knew, Haldir laughed before revealing his true form: an incredibly old man hunched over. he had purple eyes and notably six purple identical[^8] that attached to his back, which kept hovering just above the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], sounding a bit annoyed, announced that he had been honest with them, and he wanted to know why they hadn't been honest with him. plus, now that he had revealed his true form, he thought [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] should do the same for him. He suddenly clicked his fingers, causing powerful magics to wash over them, stripping everyone of their changes: Korrigan lost his horns, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] appeared as a ghost over Mordecai's shoulder, and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] doing the same over [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to panic. They had no idea who the person was on their shoulder. Mordecai tried to explain that this was [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], but they had no idea what that was, and the name had never appeared in any of their memories.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
