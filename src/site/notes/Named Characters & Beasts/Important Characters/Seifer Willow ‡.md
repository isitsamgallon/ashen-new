### Overview
One of the chief tacticians for [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] 's army during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. She faced off against [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/General Midus †\|General Midus †]] many times during the way. She was said to be a brutal commander who would sacrifice anything to achieve her lord's goals. At one point, she was said to use massive fiery explosions that destroyed not only [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] 's forces but also her [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] forces. She devised a plan to lure [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] forces into a trap. Her [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] huddled closely around her, forming a living shield of fiery death. As [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] army encircled them, Seifer unleashed the full power of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], sacrificing herself and her comrades to obliterate the enemy. She was later revealed to be alive inside [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]. She now possesses [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] after they touch the crown.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to ask [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] if they knew anything, but she refused to tell them anything more than it was God they had not encountered yet and 'they' would be looking for them. She cackled when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pleaded for her to explain what she meant. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it would be best to set up camp as it was getting dark anyway. They went into the nearby fairest, with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] covering all of their tracks as they went, and found a secluded spot for them to sleep. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they were sure their Leomunds Tiny Hut spell prevented almost everything from entering it. They soon had the spell up, and the other decided it would be best to take shifts watching [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make sure nothing bad happened. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wondered how much of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] 's powers could be used through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's body. Seifer explained that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's body was too weak to use her full powers, but as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] got more powerful, she could use more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
