#INFORMATION_MISSING_OR_OUT-OF-DATE 
### Overview
One of the chief tacticians for [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] 's army during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. She faced off against [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/General Midus †\|General Midus †]] many times during the way. She was said to be a brutal commander who would sacrifice anything to achieve her lord's goals. At one point, she was said to use massive fiery explosions that destroyed not only [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] 's forces but also her [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] forces. She devised a plan to lure [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] forces into a trap. Her [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] huddled closely around her, forming a living shield of fiery death. As [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] army encircled them, Seifer unleashed the full power of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], sacrificing herself and her comrades to obliterate the enemy. She was later revealed to be alive inside [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]. She now possesses [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] after they touch the crown.

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | "If that means doing things that we're not proud of, then so be it, I guess" There was a brief pause before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] spoke again, "I'm not going to lie. I haven't spoken to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] since the incident. I get the feeling she's giving me the cold shoulder."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] stood to the side and gave [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] some peace as they spoke with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | The silence in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s mind was a fragile thing, broken by the soft, echoing voice of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]. She began not with a demand, but with a memory and a reason for why she wanted fried chicken. It was a scent, a taste that transported her to a long gone world, a time when her father was alive, when she was safe, and when happiness was not a memory but her reality. That world, she explained, her voice thick with a grief that had not faded, was ripped away from her. And the only other time that specific, profound happiness had returned, she revealed, was when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] had found her, a furious and doomed spirit trapped in a [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]’s body. He had picked her up, and in doing so, had given her a semblance of family again, a cruel comfort given her eternal imprisonment within his own mind, forever severed from any afterlife reunion with her lost loved ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | A flicker of hope crossed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s thoughts. “Is there no way?” they ventured, suggesting the possibility of a spell, a plane shift to a realm where she might find them again and say hi. But [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]’s sorrow curdled into a sharp and focused bitterness. She dismissed the idea; her peace, she insisted, was not to be found in some afterlife. It was tied to vengeance. The one who had destroyed her life, who had torn down her noble house and now profaned its legacy, needed to suffer the same depth of pain she had been forced to endure. She spoke of her past power, of a great house that once bent to her will, now occupied by those who used its comforts to inflict hurt upon others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s soft, single-word rebuttal, “No”, hung in the air between them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] was quick to clarify it was not a plea for them to act, but a statement of her own tortured conscience. The true source of her anguish in that moment, she confessed, was their conflict. She was fighting with him, the one person who had become her reluctant family. When [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] whispered an apology, she challenged it, forcing him to admit that his life was no longer just his own. They were bound together. Seizing on this, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] steered the conversation toward a fragile truce. Trust, they stated, had to be the foundation of their forced union. He proposed a path forward: transparency, and the help of his own friends, his chosen family. If they worked together, he assured her, perhaps they could all find a sense of belonging again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | The offer of transparency seemed to unlock a deeper, more guarded part of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]’s heart. “I lied,” she admitted, the words a heavy confession. There was another person, a man named Kaelen. With halting words, drawn out by [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s gentle prompting, she revealed the truth. Kaelen had been the love of her life, her husband. And he was gone. The old guilt, a familiar poison, seeped into her spectral voice as she delivered the final, devastating blow: “He died because of me. Because I wasn't strong enough to help and save those around me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]        | A strange, quiet calm settled over them. “Very good. We've been transparent,” [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] said, her tone softened, the sharp edges of her anger momentarily smoothed away. When [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], in a final gesture of peace, asked if there was anything she wanted, she declined. “I think it's time I thank you,” she said, and then she began to recede.

Suddenly, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]], whose affects had been quietened by the antimagic field, spoke up. She told [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] not to sign the contract, telling them it was a soul contract for life, stating that they would have to do whatever the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia told them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if the contract could state that they would only have to do the roles mentioned earlier.

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wondered how much of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] 's powers could be used through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's body. Seifer explained that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's body was too weak to use her full powers, but as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] got more powerful, she could use more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] were very uncomfortable with this but soon saw there was nothing they could do but order them to direct them to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. The cult guided them there, with many rushing ahead to clear the paths and roads to line by the door like a king's guards would. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] what they thought about all of this, to which she said she thought of something very funny. before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could ask, they took control of the body and made them float in the air before letting a large wave of fire erupt from their hands. Horrified, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] had taken over and caused that because she thought it would be funny. They quickly ran inside before more people started staring at them. they were guided up the stairs and into the councillor's office, where [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] sat. Keith had his feet on the desk while Steve, who was wearing a white and [[gold\|gold]] clock and holding a shepherd crook, was standing reading a document at a table. When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] walked, they immediately rose to attention.                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]". |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], sounding a bit annoyed, announced that he had been honest with them, and he wanted to know why they hadn't been honest with him. plus, now that he had revealed his true form, he thought [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] should do the same for him. He suddenly clicked his fingers, causing powerful magics to wash over them, stripping everyone of their changes: Korrigan lost his horns, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] appeared as a ghost over Mordecai's shoulder, and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] doing the same over [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to panic. They had no idea who the person was on their shoulder. Mordecai tried to explain that this was [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], but they had no idea what that was, and the name had never appeared in any of their memories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | After a deep breath, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] says that in their party, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is possessed by a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|war criminal]], Aidan is possessed by a God, another may share a body with a dead party member, and he is [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s toy. Weird or even bad things are bound to happen, but they're trying their best to make sure that the world is ok. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is still sad because, in his eyes, he isn't this paragon of good that everyone says he is. Like everyone, he has done bad things, sometimes for the greater good and sometimes for selfish reasons, making him feel like a fake and he is sick of pretending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Contemplating the leaflet, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] continued their journey towards [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|the All-father]] Temple. With such fiery motifs, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] couldn’t help but draw comparisons with the group and the cult of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] and asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow if she knew anything about this brotherhood through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]. However, she was less than helpful - claiming that she had never heard of them before. Unconvinced, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] kept pressing her for information, asking her very bluntly how she died. This provoked outrage from the dead woman in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s head, demanding that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] should kill him on the spot for such insensitivity and rudeness. Naturally, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] refused, a little tired of the constant desperation of the woman’s violence towards his party members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly rushed to the door as they arrived and politely knocked before entering. Tourists paused to look at him quizzically before resuming their way through the open double doors of the temple. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked confused in return, as all they knew was that it was polite to knock before entering somewhere, especially somewhere important. Irritated by [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s naïvety, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pushed past him - announcing to the group that he wanted to take [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to see [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] with a glint of contempt in their eye. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was growing desperate for answers, not just about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], but also [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. They were confident that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|she]] was responsible for all this, but why? Why would she go to these lengths? Why was he the only one freaking out?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Anxious for answers, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stormed into [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s worship room, practically pulling [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] by the scruff of their neck. Seeing the same orb as before, their voice came out more like a demand than the question they had intended. They requested to know more about what was happening with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and whether it was possible to dispose of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]. The orb considered for a moment before revealing that they were more than happy to share this information, but it would come at a cost. The orb was willing to trade the information [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sought in exchange for their knowledge that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] was the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The orb clarified that this would affect the entire party. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was uncertain if this was a deal they could make on behalf of the whole group and asked if they could wait for the others to return and consult them for their opinions. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] also felt concerned that if they forgot about this, they might not take her back to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Soon, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] landed on the floor just as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was put down and disconnected from the hive mind. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] feels sick, but otherwise, the experience was just as the orb had explained it to them, they had no memories of what they had 'processed'. They got up and began to explain the situation to the others who were hesitant to take the deal, and when they put it to the vote, everyone but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] voted no. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to console [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], explaining that there would be plenty of other chances to learn more about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] - ones that wouldn't cause them all to forget important information. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is disappointed but eventually understands where they are all coming from and mentally decides to do their best to at least get to know [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a little before jumping to such rash decisions. The orb made a sound like it was clearing its throat and said they had a side of the bargain to fulfil and explained that, to their knowledge, there was no way to reverse the possession of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]].                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | Outside, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took a deep breath as they mentally prepared to enter [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' room. Questioning out loud if this was really the correct thing to do. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suggested that I couldn't hurt to ask, worst case, they could all step in to help if it came to that. Slightly reassured, they all entered the room. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] was sitting near the altar reading as they all entered. He greeted them warmly, asking if there was anything he could do to help. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dodged around the subject as they asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] knew of someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he knew of her when they both fought in the war and explained that she was a great general who gave her life to destroy an entire army Battalion. He explained that in some circles, she is regarded as almost a sudo [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] comes clean and explains that they actually found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], and she currently has processed his brain. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] looks terrified and asks to know the full story and becomes increasingly terrified when they explain how they found [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] and then [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], now on the verge of panic, begged to know that the sword was safe and hidden away still. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] deliver the troubling news that the sword was stolen by someone they suspect to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] broke out in a cold sweat and told them to follow him as he walked incredibly quickly for an old man. He took them out into the main library and into the back areas through a door labelled 'Authorised staff only'. Down a few corridors, they walked through a heavily guarded gate and down a steep flight of stairs. until they entered a large and dark room - illuminated only by a pristine white pillar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan whispers to Drache and asks if they can quickly cast [Detect Good and Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good) and see what they learn. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] does just then and, to his horror, detects a considerable amount of undead energy emanating from Mordecai. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] hurriedly explains what he feels to Korrigan, who claims he'll cast his protection spell on Mordecai so they can ensure that Mordecai does not lose control over his body. The voice retorts that if they do that, they will make sure that when she leaves, she will make sure there will be nothing left of Mordecai's brain to function. Suddenly, it clicks with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] doesn't have any family, but they did recall that in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]], there was a female war general called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]. Willow confirms that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is correct and says that if they've read their bible, they know what can happen when too much of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' power is channelled through someone, and she can do that if anyone makes any wrong moves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | She asks where they got this book since it is quite heretical to own a piece of material that looks at [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] in such a good light and the two, slightly panicked explain that they found it in an [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] under [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] surrounded by flames of an exploded researcher. She notes that that is how most followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] tend to operate  (referencing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]) leading Mordecai to talk about the man that exploded outside the airship and asking about [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]]. Unfortunately, she has no idea what either of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
