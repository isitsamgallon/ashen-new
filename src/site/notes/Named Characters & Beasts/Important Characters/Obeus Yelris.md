>Obeus is a half-elf and, therefore, is born with some deformities - namely a weak immune system.

### Overview
Obeus Yelris is the daughter of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] and the current Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. She is described in books as being a very kind and understanding ruler and has "grand military plans". In reality, she doesn't leave the palace enough to understand what the current situation of her nation is like. 

When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met her, she had been locked up in the inner sanctum and had never been outside, due to her compromised immune system. The Party had come to propose trade agreements and warn her of the Bandits nearby with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Grom\|Grom]]. For the first time being interested in the outside world, she demands that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] break her out and take her on an adventure. She has since travelled to many different nations including the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|OFC]]. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]].

### Personality
Obeus is a quiet and thought girl who is often happy just to experience the world with the party. Although she is highly intelligent, she is also quite innocent of a lot of things people take for granted. For example, when the party first broke her out of the palace in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16]] she had no idea what she would need to pack and just stuffed her bag with as many books, gold and furniture as she could. 

She is often quick to tears when people accidentally offend her or when people forget to include her in the counts for plans.

### Description
Obeus is a small Elf with sickly pale skin and flowing black hair and can often be found wearing high-quality clothing and carrying some form of book.

### Other Information
- She cried when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] said that they would be her friend especially now that they would be travelling together. 
- [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] was the only one to understand truly why her guards wouldn't let her leave the palace due to his similar nature as a Half-[[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]].
- She has been travelling with them as a [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|Companions]] since being broken out of the palace.

| [[Session Notes/Session 48\|Session 48]]                                 | The leader explained that peace was not an option, and they were fighting so the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] would be free again and allowed to operate however they pleased. Notably, he used Ehobels' system of governance as an example of what they wanted to do in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. After further prodding, it was revealed that the leader, although not Elven himself, was part of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and was sent to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] by [[Admin/Spells/Command\|command]] of Empress [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | Returning, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] suddenly realised that in the note they had left [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], they said they would meet her in the pub in the morning, but it was now past lunch. He ran to the pub, using his magic to propel him quickly to his destination. He reached the pub startlingly quickly and asked the barkeeper if he knew if a young half-elf had stopped by. The barkeep said he had no idea, but maybe some [[gold\|gold]] could help him remember. the barkeep asked for 15 [[gold\|gold]], but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] put 20 on the counter. the barkeep explained she had been at the pub for half an hour or so before leaving. she left a note that simply read, "I'm sorry, I knew".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | Before they could say anything else, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] cleared his throat with a commanding cough before claiming that it seemed that the spell didn't work for everyone and that there was one more person who wasn't telling the full truth. As he said this, his eyes narrowed to the back of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Following the headmaster's gaze, they found him staring at [[[[Obeus Yelris\|[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] Yelris]], who looked to be on the verge of tears. With a click of his fingers, she let out a scream, she lost all the strength in her legs and crumpled to the floor. As she did so, it looked like a spectral being was being yanked from her. The being crumpled on the floor was small and bony[^2] but wore the same golden mask as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. "Ah, an [[Named Characters & Beasts/Aspect of Ebis Daro\|Aspect of Ebis Daro]], I presume", reasoned the headmaster. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' eyes narrowed in anger at the Empress, but before anyone could say anything, the aspect stood up and began readying a spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | They all quickly rushed to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' side as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] began to heal her with magic. She soon woke up, her expression one of shame and embarrassment before anyone could get a word in edgeways, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] looked at her, his expression unreadable as he said, "It seemed the empress had and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] in her pocket, care to explain why?". [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] broke into tears as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] was reprimanded by [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] for being so unkind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

With nothing else to do they decide to write a note and have it sent to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] to tell her they're not mad and they could meet them at the local tavern or at [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. With that they went to the mail room which was located in the teleportation area of the university.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | Without hesitation, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] put 10 [[gold\|gold]] on the table. the clerk smiled and said it would be sent soon. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked how they knew where it needed to as [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had only written "To [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]" on the outside. The clerk said it was magic, and it would know who to send to. With that done [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] led to a small tavern in the residential area of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Along the way, with a sly smile, Mordecai suggested they do shot again, and they were thinking absinthe would be perfect. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was hesitant to agree after how bad their hangover was the last time they drank absinthe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | They soon came up with a plan to buy the book and then use its abilities to rewrite history to say they had also received the cloak for free. They tried to get the money for the book but found they were short, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] offered to pay the money for them as it was clear how much Mordecai wanted to get this cloak, and they wanted to cover it as a gift to them. Once the ability was used[^3], the world suddenly went dark before returning to normal, with Mordecai wearing the cloak. they began to celebrate before Mordecai felt something in their pocket - a loan contract for the came. In this rewrite, the owner gave them the cloak for testing and waved the holding fee. they were obliged to return the cloak within the year. They resolved to use the book again soon to try and fix the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | The headmaster nodded and murmured that that was just going to have to do without other options before speaking up. He declared that he would answer their previous question, but he would need one person to help with this. He drew his gaze to the back of the party at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] and declared that one last person needed to join them. He clicked his finger, and with a scream from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] was pulled out from her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

She noted this experience in her journal, recognizing it as an aspect of life she had not considered prior to leaving the palace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The orb considered for a moment before revealing that they were more than happy to share this information, but it would come at a cost.

The orb clarified that this would affect the entire party. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was uncertain if this was a deal they could make on behalf of the whole group and asked if they could wait for the others to return and consult them for their opinions. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] also felt concerned that if they forgot about this, they might not take her back to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] doesn't hear anything from them. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] all decided it would be best to go back up their mountain and check [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body and cave to see if they could find or learn anything about what happened or what might happen now that Ebis has the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. Travelling up the mountain again, they find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body fully decomposed and the one made out of solid [[gold\|gold]]. Concerned about the abnormality of the body decomposition rate and the [[gold\|gold]] skeleton, they decided to investigate. Mordecai suddenly remembers that they used [Speak With Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead)  from a wild magic surge from a fight a while back. They use it to learn more while Aidan figures out how to return the body to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to add to the nation's funds. The spell gave them five questions to ask the dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Suddenly, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] begins to cry as he reminisces and mentions the gecko they had met in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Mannnnnn †\|Mannnnnn †]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly figures out that [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] is probably putting his grief on the gecko instead of Chenris. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] then [Wild Shapes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) into a gecko and keeps crying as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tentatively puts him on their shoulder. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is enamoured by this ability and excitedly asks what else people can do. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] unenthusiastically says they can use magic, while Aidan says he is good at sneaking. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] says that she can also cast magic but not much else. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] interjects, saying that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]] is much more than a magic caster and is the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. She blushes slightly as she confirms this to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who thinks that's amazing and gives a polite bow that she brushes off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Thirty minutes into the journey, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] decided to test [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] further by speaking in Sylvan, the language of the fey, to see if they would respond to him. To his surprise, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had no idea what [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] was saying, asking them to speak in common. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] was bewildered, screaming, "HOW DOES A FEY NOT SPEAK SYLVAN?!?". He was so shocked he had to inspect [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] further to confirm their fey status and confirmed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was, in fact, Eldarin - definitely a fey specifies. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] starts to cycle through all of his known languages to see what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would respond to. He first tried Primordial to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responded confused, asking why they were now speaking Primordial, noting it felt like they were excluding the rest of the group. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] ignored him and carried on his test and learnt that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew all the same languages as Chenris. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] surmised that the big tell would be to get them to respond to Ancient Dwarven so they asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] for something and she flatly said "something" in Ancient Dwarven. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responds in kind, still very confused but putting further credence to their theory that [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and chenris' memories must have merged. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs deeply and absent-mindedly questions "Why would [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|she]] do this??"                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Arriving at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], they are confronted with a small fishing village comprised mostly of hearty sailors, and the stench of fresh fish clouds the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] approaches. The person they deem to have the best vibe and strikes up a conversation. It's an incredibly gruff sailor who greets them well enough. Getting straight to the point, they ask if the sailor could take them to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]], he says he can, but it would cost them. The sailor says that it's a long journey, plus they would need a return trip, and he would need to get supplies. All in, it would cost them 1000 [[Gold\|Gold]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to haggle the price when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] stepped up and offered to pay the fee, handing over 100 Platinum to the sailor. She explained that she was feeling quite bad for not helping out as much, and it was the least she could do for the people who have been so good to her. They all thank her, and the sailor points to his boat, a smaller wooden ship that doesn't even have an inside or lower deck, but there was enough space for some bed rolls and to eat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | After travelling for most of the day at sea, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] see a huge ship with golden sales, most likely part of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]]. The sailor explained that if they managed to board, then they would most likely take all their money and kidnap [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] as a slave. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] quickly casts the [Gust of Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-gust-of-wind?srsltid=AfmBOorwXJ5zKU-E1NM_z-xkyOugDjkUXDfjqbrLN6fJRNdLAN0WsWXv) spell into the sale to make the boat go as fast as possible. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] if they would be able to call a whale to come and toe their boat so they could get away. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] tries his best but completely messes up the call; he does so so bad that he might have even scared most of them off. The larger boat starts to close in on them and is about 1000 ft away. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] spots some icebergs off in the distance that they could use to escape the fleet; he falsely assumes that their smaller boat would be quick enough to reach the icebergs in time. The large ship catches up quicker than expected and suddenly shoots a large metal claw onto the boat. It latches on through large wood splinters everywhere, damaging the boat. The large boat was about 40 feet away from them now.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] decided to burn the rope with their magic while [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] attempted to hide [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]], it wasn't very good since there weren't many places to hide on their small boat. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uses minor illusions to hide the flames on the rope so that if any tried to slide down it, they would be burnt or fall into the ocean.  [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] uses his bow to cast a large [[[Lightning Bolt\|[Lightning Bolt]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt?srsltid=AfmBOopYOAMOiwlColBdpBSjbi8_9qxrM2Kq7jLYgB0ScN5y8O4ch0CK) to tear through the large ship's sails, shredding the first one completely and damaging other parts of the boat. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] casts [Fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball), mentioning it is time for a 'cleansing flame ', and manages to destroy the middle mast/ sail. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gets excited after seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s Fireball and tells them that they can do the same. With that, they cast Fly on themselves and flew up over the ship and threw their own fireball at the wheel and sails near it, damaging the ship's captain and crew. In a truly mental moment, the captain continues to bark orders at their crew as the ship begins to turn to fire their canons at the boat. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] quickly casts [Fog Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618910-fog-cloud) on the canons to stop most of them from being able to aim properly.                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | They carry on up the mountain. Before they can make it too far, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] confesses that she is not built for the extreme cold and wouldn't be much help to them and says she'll wait for them at the boat. Concerned about the Skeletons, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggests that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] uses the [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) spell on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]]. The spell gives her one reply that she could use as a distress call. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] begrudgingly admits that this is a good idea and does just that. They watch as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] disappears into the snow before carrying on up the mountain. As they progress up the mountain, they begin to really struggle with the cold. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] offers them his cloak for extra warmth, which seems to really help them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

She admits that she is unsure since nothing like this has ever happened in Ehobel. She is mainly focused on completing their task so they can get away with their lives. As they walked down the path they encountered a small room with animated skeletons roaming around it and a [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Note From Velthis About Reanimated skeletons\|note]] on a nearby table. Chenris used a [[Admin/Spells/Mage Hand\|mage hand]] to grab it.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | The Party try to theories why they were attacked, if they're all working for the same guy. Chenris suggests that these people might have been taken over by something and it probably doesn't matter to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] as he wins either if they die or manage to retrieve the crystal. Korrigan and Aidan find a bunch of [[Gold\|Gold]] on a nearby table. Aidan says as they were the ones who found it, they should be the ones to keep it. Korrigan gets mad at the fact that Aidan would be so greedy and demands that they should share it evenly with the whole party. Aidan relents and they share out the gold evenly.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | Chenris turned his fading gaze toward [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]], his tone almost fatherly but full of caution.  “[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]… you remind me too much of myself. Always searching for answers in books, hoping that knowledge alone will protect you. But it won’t. The world is far crueller than any story you’ll read in a library. An insufferable fool taught me that. Don’t lock yourself away, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]. Live. Learn from the world itself, not just its pages.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | Korrigan pulls out the map and asks where they should be going. Chenris suggest going to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and stopping by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to see what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Korrigan suggests we also go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] since it's on the way to Dawnhaven. Mordecai asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] if she has anywhere she wants to go, but she says she doesn't have anywhere she specifically wants to go, but she should probably return to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] soon, her people probably already think she's dead or kidnapped, although she mentions that she wants to see [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] before going home. Fearing the worst, Mordecai asks how they would pick a new emperor. She explains that one of the lords would be elected into power but that it would take at least 30 years to pick a new ruler, Chenris is surprised, asking, "That quickly?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | The next morning, they woke up and headed straight for the Wyvern Cave. Approaching the cave, korrigan starts to have PTSD flashbacks and is unable to cross the threshold of the cave. Instead, opting to [Wild Shape](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) into a Stoat and hide. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] sighs and tells Chenris and Mordecai she watches over him. Entering the cave, they quickly began their search, Chenris scanned the bookshelves and found very few interesting as most were fairytale books or fiction books. As he scanned the book, one caught his eye: [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Unbroken Coin - A Tale of Two Brothers\|The Unbroken Coin - A Tale of Two Brothers]]. It was an ancient-looking red leather-bound book with two golden masks on the front. Skimming through the book, he knew it was important and began to read. Just as he finished the first page, Mordecai called out to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The town is built on the mountain edge breaking the town into tiers going up the surface of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] with the shrine at the highest point. The town surrounding the shrine is protected by large palisade walls. It is currently late afternoon, so Drache suggests resting up now so they can sneak into [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] in the dead of night and have a better chance of rescuing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. They go to the Adventures Guild where two [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s are running the reception. Mordecai is unwilling to speak, not wanting to be accidentally noticed by anyone, so Drache is the one to ask for their usual two rooms. But once he is given the rooms, he insists they show him the way - something that is not typically at all, but they relent and awkwardly show them the way. Once shown to their room, Drache suggests having 'an emergency meeting' to discuss their plans. One of the receptionists comments "That's a weird name for a fivesome". Korrigan, forgetting that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was with them, says there are only 4 of them causing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to become mad at him again. She runs off stating that she'll get her own room. Korrigan tries to apologise but it's a lost cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | By this point, Mordecai has made it to the room to find it unchanged since they last were there. He uses [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) to update the rest of the party on the situation. They decide to wait for Korrigan and the key so they free [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and escape quickly. Drache suggests that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] should keep watch for any patrols and she runs off to keep a look out. Mordecai, while waiting for the key, spends some time comforting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and making her as comfortable as possible, when she looks behind him and screams. Before he can react, the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] is knocked unconscious by a club from behind. Hearing the scream, Drache is about to jump into action before he does Chenris suggests that he should use his reply to Mordecai and find out what happened, after getting no reply they decide it is time they enter the room. Chenris surmises that they will need another healer if they get into a fight and rushes to grab [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

From their vantage point, they can see a guard walking a prisoner down to their location. Chenris is dumbfounded when he recognises Aidan as the prisoner because as far as he was aware, the rogue was in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] still. He is unable to ascertain the identity of the guard, however. As they get closer, Aidan spots Chenris and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] hiding and motions that everything is ok.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

As they all go to leave, Drache returns the favour by spitting at Damascus and taking his Great Axe as a prize and saying "This is where you fucking belong".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | As they explored the ancient, almost hallowed halls of [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]], [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] spent some time investigating the incessant itching he had been experiencing recently. To his horror, he realised that it originated from the bite mark he received from the zombie squirrel [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|a few sessions ago]]. With no way to deal with the wound in the sprawling dungeon, he puts that information aside to focus on the door now in front of them. They inspect the door from traps, clearing the door of suspicion, he tries to open the door as quietly as possible. To his, and the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s horror, the door swung open with a bone-rattling screech alerting the [Mummies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16961-mummy) within. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] is unaware of this happening as he is still in the previous room looking for clues. However, the combined force of Korrigan, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was more than enough to best a singular mummy, making short work of it. Unfortunately during the fight, the itch on Korrigan's arm made him miss the mummy and hit Mordecai in the chest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | Before they carry on with their expedition, Korrigan shows Chenris the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|book of poems]] and points to the poem called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes#Golden Walls\|Golden Walls]] and asks if this means the walls around them are not made of real gold. After testing a sample for Pyrite, Chenris sadly concludes the walls are made of fool's gold, putting a hull on their plan to harvest the gold to use to bump the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC's]] finances. The next room of note is a short corridor with a large mirror at the end of it, Mordecai realises that the poem called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes#The Reflection\|The Reflection]] holds the secrets to progressing. The mirror's reflection seems to have some mysterious properties in how it reflects its subjects. There doesn't seem to be any distortion to the image, nor the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], only reflecting the viewer. Reading the poem, Chenris suggest saying words of affirmation to the mirror but this has no effect. Korrigan attempts to simply walk through, but when he is unable to pass he doesn't feel the cool and smooth surface he expected. Instead, it was as if he bumped into himself as he felt skin, bone a cloth. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] takes some time to study the poem and suggests they should try treating the reflection with some respect. Mordecai greets the reflection and politely says "After you". The reflection smiles and says "No I insist, after you" before moving out of the way. The rest do the same and walk straight through.   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | They are now confronted with a long corridor that holds several swinging blades, arcing at waist height. Korrigan is a feat of athleticism crawly under each of them incredibly quickly, emerging the other side unharmed. Chenris also manages to crawl through and discovers some leavers which slow the swing blades significantly. Mordecai is small enough in his dog form to walk under unharmed. Aiden, the more dexterous of the group manages to easily leap over the blades. However, he doesn't properly check if he has cleared the blade before standing up and gets sliced across his back, and due to the mummy rot curse, he is unable to heal the wound. Finally, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] is able to clear the first blade before being cut down by the second. In a stroke of ingenuity, Korrigan uses [Thorn Whip]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thorn-whip) to lasso her foot and pull her body over to them so they can heal her with a potion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | On one side of the room is an impossibly large amount of [[Gold\|Gold]]. On the other side is the Mummy Lord, seemingly asleep, in front of the Lord is an onyx black sword. They all hesitate before entering, [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|Poems from the Sand Dunes]] still had some unused poems, however, none of them could figure out how they might be used in this situation. Korrigan summons the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] to interact with the room and once it touched the gold coins, the Mummy Lord awoke. [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] starts to shake violently upon its revival and sand begins to fall from the ceiling. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are then presented with a dilemma: the door to the room is slowly closing, should they enter or leave? All but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] were able to dive into the room before the door shut. Now they were left face-to-face with the master of the temple. The Mummy Lord speaks angrily in Infernal to the group, Mordecai, being the only one to speak the language responds with Message. The Lord is confused, not knowing where he is. Mordecai tries to explain he is in a temple on the boundary of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], The Mummy Lord's anger and confusion increase as he is unaware of those names. He exclaims, that he is the ruler of a grand and ancient kingdom in the desert where many adored him. They then make the link between the poem and the Mummy Lord's life and explain he was betrayed. This only seems to fully unleash the lord's wrath, as he summons his sword from the ground and stands from his golden throne. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | Almost in celebration of their accomplishment, the pyramid began to violently shake and sand started to leak into the chamber. Chenris was brought back with a quick healing spell from korrigan and they both destroyed the heart, making sure the Mummy Lord was unable to return. With their foe completely vanquished, Chenris turned his attention to their escape and noticed that the door could be pushed open. In a moment of desperation, his body sprung into action and began to push. As he pushed with all his might, his armour sprung to life, flowing with magical power, greatly aiding in opening the heavy door. Korrigan and Mordecai joined in on the effort and together they managed to open the door enough for the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] to fit through and push the button to open it. Meanwhile, Aiden grabbed as much gold as he could carry before joining them in the corridor outside the chamber. Chenris did the same before joining them. In the corridor, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] was nowhere to be found, fearing the worst they desperately called her name. In response a bright purple light appeared in the next room, it was a portal with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' hand reaching through beckoning them to safety. With little options left and the sand up to their chests, they went through the portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | They cross the portal to find themselves on a road they recognise to be near [[Locations/OFC/Foxtail Orchards\|Foxtail Orchards]] with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] waiting for them. Shocked to see the ever-mysterious cloaked figure, Mordecai asked what happened and why he was there. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] explained that when the door closed on her she went looking for help and found Xekai who offered to help them. Xekai spoke up, looking disgusted at how damaged and bloody they all were after the fight and opened a portal. A halfling woman soon walked through and asked if he wanted the usual, Xekai nodded and she fully healed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. They were now filled with questions that seemed to flow from their mouths like a vast waterfall, however, Xekai refused to answer any of them. Instead opting to say "At least you cleared that pyramid, a little behind schedule perhaps, but a good job nonetheless". Korrigan's questions about this schedule were only met with Xekai's refusal to answer. Korrigan then realises that Xekai was the one who killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]], otherwise known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' father. He tries to quietly point this out to Mordecai but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhears him and bursts into tears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] | They head out and they give [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] a chance to be lookout, saying its a big part of being and adventurer. Sometime later she sees something and before she explains what is, she runs off down to a sparkling pond down a small hill next to the road. Mordecai messages to ask what is happening and to warn her not to touch or interact with things since even pretty things can be dangerous, so she waits at the pond for the party to catch up. Mordecai looks into the pond, he sees himself and he things he looks really good today and discovers the longer he looks into the pond, the more beautiful he becomes. They step back as they start to realises something is wrong but keeps staring. His reflect keeps getting more beautiful and his face starts to shift. He notes to Korrigan how weird the pond is but he does not see what Mordecai sees. In the reflection, Mordecai skin starts to become scaly and his physic starts to get bigger as he morphs into a [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], however, Mordecai still sees it as the most attractive thing he ever seen. For a brief moment his vision swaps to being under the water looking back at his body. Its very peaceful underneath with rolling winds and bright blue skies, before he swaps back to his normal vision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] | In the room the mummy was found in, they find a long-dead skeleton holding a book called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|Poems from the Sand Dunes]] which contains poems that seem to give hints on how to solve the puzzles with the temple. The room they are in has a deep in the well in the middle with four statues holding different colour gems. The ceiling has a small gap in it that is shining a thin beam of light on the red gem. Finding the appropriate poem, they aim the light on to the green, then blue, then purple and then finally into the well which then opens the door to the next room. This room is filled with 5 Mummies which the party lure the to the door, a chock point, and then using Area of Effect spells to quickly dispatch them, Korrigan entangling them with vines to slow them down and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] and Mordecai slinging fire spells at them. Chenris and Aidan loot the Sarcophagi in the room and find a decent amount of a [[Gold\|Gold]] and another hidden mummy they also quickly dispatch off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | After some investigating they find a small hidden button on the desk which opens a hatch that allows them to open the door wide enough for Mordecai to get through. the group splits up with Korrigan, Mordecai and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] exploring the tunnels further and Chenris and Drache going back to the library to research the tunnels. The tunnel exploration team manage to and open a door to the councillors rooms and shout for the others to join them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Mordecai screams NOOO and jumps in front to take the arrow and save the note, falling unconscious in the process.

Aidan says its a bit too late for that and asks if Gods have been known to grant people power in return for deals.
