### Overview
Uti is a dragon and allegedly the last person to ever talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]] before [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] made contact with it. They were described as a red dragon from a far-off land called [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]. Their story was eventually adapted into a popular book called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Loneliest Dragon\|The Loneliest Dragon]]. They were later revealed to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and lived on the [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] guarding the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]] for the likes of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. They were sworn to kill anyone who entered the island to make sure Ebis couldn't sneak on. They were later killed by [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] when they travelled to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] to learn more about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. 

### Notable Information
- According to the [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|priest]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]], there is a specific way that you must talk to Uti or they will attack you on site. Unfortunately, this, and the knowledge of how to correctly talk to Uti, was lost due it to being contingent on a deal with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] - a deal neither of them took.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and tells them to stay put before confronting the dragon. Mordecai and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] ignore him and run out to join him. Mordecai exclaims that they both did stupid things in the past to face this together. The dragon lands in front of them and commands them to explain why they would want to travel to such a remote island. Mordecai replies in Draconic, saying that they wanted to come and speak to it. Korrigan explains that they know [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and know that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] was the last person to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Uti stares at them before narrowing their eyes at Mordecai. "You touched the crown, didn't you?" it said question. Mordecai apologises for doing so, as they had no idea. Uti explains that they can not let anyone leave the island because of that. Shocked, Mordecai tries to sacrifice himself to allow the others to leave. The rest refuse to let this happen, with Korrigan exclaiming that Uti will kill one; they must destroy all of them as if they were a meal deal. Before anything else can happen, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears from a portal and uses some strange magic to freeze everyone but Mordecai on the spot with a large sigh. Uti explains that everyone here has to die, as coming onto this island is enough of a threat to the world. Mordecai claims they have enough audacity that they can't get through this, and nothing terrible will happen and swears on everyone's life. Uti exclaims that swearing on these lives means everyone must fight them to the death, and either way - the Gods do not work like that. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] unfreezes everyone before going back through the portal. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | The battle with Uti was short but decisive. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began by activating his Axe and began to hack and cleave at the dragon. Korrigan set up his healing spirit before shooting his bow. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took this time to cast [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste) on [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], causing the barbarian to move even faster than usual and hit with even more ferocity than before. Aidan tried out his new magic and cast [Hex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex) on Uti to Debuff them some more. Finally, Mordecai threw a firebolt at the dragon, only to realise that fire did not affect Uti. Letting out a huge roar, Uti sprang into action and unleashed a massive barrage of flames that engulfed many party]] members. Everyone managed to survive, but Mordecai was severely injured. The fight wasn't over as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] attacked again, with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] doing a lot of damage as he found he could hit harder and faster. Mordecai used their Metamagic to make two strong Lightning [Chromatic Orb](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/chromatic-orb) that dealt much damage to Uti, leaving its breath ragged. Korrigan was able to finish it off with some well-placed shots from his bow. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] fell to the ground dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], Aidan, and Korrigan go to see the crown left in the ruined castle when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] arrives. Looking at it now, there is no longer a flame from the ruby, and it seems like a regular crown. Korrigan wants to bury it. However, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wants to cast Identify on it so they know exactly what it does and see if they can learn how to reverse its effects. As they discuss their next steps, they hear faint chanting coming from a nearby staircase, and Korrigan rushes to grab Mordecai and Drache so they can investigate further. The voice tells Mordecai to destroy the crown as it means nothing to them anymore. Mordecai becomes concerned and thinks this is a trick by the voice to free it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This helps him calm down until he hears in his ear "or my will" from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Some time later, Chenris and Mordecai return from [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|Aeloria's room]] looking incredibly troubled, especially Mordecai. Chenris still looks incredibly angry, still in his summer form. Korrigan tries to ask what happened and all Mordecai can muster is a meek sorry. He goes on to explain that he was offered a deal and now looking back he really regrets not taking it. If he had, then everyone would know all about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and so much more but it came a step cost of himself. Taking the deal would lead to him forgetting everything about himself and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|his mother]] all of him would be gone and would start from scratch. upon hearing this Korrigan is on verge of tears and gives him the biggest hug and explains that he received a similar deal but he at least got to keep most of his memories. Mordecai start to weep and Korrigan comforts him by saying it ok, if you think about it we didn't even know Uti existed a few weeks ago and they learnt so much since then, we can always learn about the dragon the old fashioned way.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | When weighing up their options, Mordecai says, that whatever they do he can stay with Aidan and cast [Dispel Magic]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) If and when needed. Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Korrigan then asks about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]]. The God reveals that the dragon was a personal friend of his. The dragon was plagued with loneliness and had lost something very precious to them and spent a lot of its time searching for it. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] clarifies by saying they aren't sure what is exactly but they assume it's a mysterious weapon called the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]]. However, the being does not know more than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Mordecai steps in and asks what he would have to give for the same information. The orb says because he isn't a part of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] the deal would be a lot harsher. This deal would lead to Mordecai forgetting everything about himself. Chenris starts circling through all his emotions as he silently contemplates his options. Mordecai tries to tell him that this isn't right and he shouldn't take the deal, although he is unaware if chenris can hear his pleas or not. The orb tries to bargain with more information like info on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and "how to make them treat you right". Chenris hears within the whirlwind of information in their head, that the first part of the passcode is the name of the person who the Auditors]] (Chenris forgets this after the conversation is over). The orb states that he just has to give this information over and he would be free. In chenris' head, he things back to all his memories of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]], the good and the bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
