### Overview
This is the black dragon that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] sent to help [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to break [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] out of his prison in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. The dragon then flew everyone back to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and also gave them lifts before [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The war for the OFC's freedom started]]. Interestingly when asked, the dragon did not know who Xekai was.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | Korrigan calls out to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], furious that something like this had to happen and could have been avoided if the man wasn't so cryptic. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears and freezes them in place with the same magic as before. He looks at Uti and then [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in dismay and exclaims that they better know what they are doing before stepping back into his portal. Behind him, they can see inside where a black dragon (possibly [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/The Black Dragon\|The Black Dragon]]) alongside the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] and numerous other people hugely talking over papers.  The portal soon closes, leaving Korrigan fuming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Chenris uses his [[Other Information/Items/Multitool\|Multitool]] to create some atmospheric music to make the speech more inspiring.

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | The party find the town preparing for the hanging and they try and figure out a game plan for saving Steve. Korrigan makes a net of vines as a cushion in case he fell off the tower when he climbs up it later. The fall would defiantly kill him, but having some on on the inside of the tower would be super useful and he could tell Steve what was happening. Mordecai uses [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self) to make him look like a guard and sneaks in to the tower with Aidan. They tell the guard that they’re changing shifts and the guard is too exhausted to question it and leaves. Aidan breaks the lock and Mordecai reveals that they’ve come to save him. As they're trying to figure out how to escape with Steve, when a massive [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/The Black Dragon\|black dragon]] arrives at the window at 3am and they all climb aboard, it was sent by [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], but the dragon didn't know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. |
