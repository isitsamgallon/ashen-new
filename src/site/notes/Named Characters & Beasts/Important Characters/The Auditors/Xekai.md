### Overview
Xekai is a mysterious underworld magic user and a former member of an organisation known as [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]. He seems to have some form of plan for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] but is unwilling to explain what it is. He was first introduced to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] when they snuck into the councillor's offices to learn secrets that could help them in their quests. He was already in the office when they found him, looking through documents for reasons he refused to reveal. He didn't stick around long before opening a portal and escaping. 

### Notable Information
- Xekai is known to be a big authority within [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s military, even foot soldiers know his wax seals and pay great respect to them. 
- He helped arrange for Steve's prison break, sending [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/The Black Dragon\|The Black Dragon]] to help them escape. 
- He is revealed to not be a morning person.
- Much later [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] found him when they were trapped in [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]], he opened a portal to help them escape the collapsing pyramid. He seemed pleased that they finally dealt with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|the pyramid]] even though they were "behind schedule". Much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s dismay he refused to elaborate on what his plan was or anything else. Notably, when [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] asked him about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] he got incredibly angry at even the mention of Akin.
- [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] later asked if he was unwilling to explain anything because that's what [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] told him to do he said no.
- When korrigan asked him, "Do you take orders from [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?" he told them that was not the case

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | Each of the large and luxurious plates of food was 'eaten.' The vampires explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was now acting almost like an Egg for their God and implied this was only possible because the Skyward Barrier had weakened. Once the food was all eaten, the women opened up a large black portal, similar to the ones [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] made. On the other side, a very confused tavern could be seen. Much to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's dismay, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began walking to the portal. They tried to tell them to reconsider their actions, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] rebutted, saying that if they wanted to, the vampires could've killed them by now, but they hadn't. The women explained that although they wished for their God, they wanted to do it without their friend dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's and women soon walked through the portal, followed quickly by the rest of the vampires and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | A crack split the air. A purple portal shimmered open behind them, humming with energy. From its centre stepped a tall figure in dark robes, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. “They’re going to die anyway,” he said flatly, surveying the scene with distaste. “Why not be a little curious?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] | The Hooded figure found what he was looking for, Chenris knows that Xekai is using forbidden magic. Xekai is the one that killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. He knew Mordecai + Drache even though they were pretending to be dumb. He silences Drache because he found then annoying and prefers talking to Mordecai. Since he has everything he needs, he opens a portal and Mordecai "accidentally" falls in the portal and manages to pickpocket some of the pages that he had stolen. Xakei finds this funny leaving the group with a few pages saying "got ya" and one official [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
