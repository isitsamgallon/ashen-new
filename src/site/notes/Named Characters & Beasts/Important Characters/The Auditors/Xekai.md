### Overview
Xekai is a mysterious underworld magic user and a former member of an organisation known as [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]. He seems to have some form of plan for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] but is unwilling to explain what it is. He was first introduced to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] when they snuck into the councillor's offices to learn secrets that could help them in their quests. He was already in the office when they found him, looking through documents for reasons he refused to reveal. He didn't stick around long before opening a portal and escaping. 

### Notable Information
- Xekai is known to be a big authority within [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s military, even foot soldiers know his wax seals and pay great respect to them. 
- He helped arrange for Steve's prison break, sending [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Kazzin\|The Black Dragon]] to help them escape.
- He is revealed to not be a morning person.
- Much later [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] found him when they were trapped in [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]], he opened a portal to help them escape the collapsing pyramid. He seemed pleased that they finally dealt with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|the pyramid]] even though they were "behind schedule". Much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s dismay he refused to elaborate on what his plan was or anything else. Notably, when [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] asked him about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] he got incredibly angry at even the mention of Akin.
- [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] later asked if he was unwilling to explain anything because that's what [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] told him to do he said no.
- When korrigan asked him, "Do you take orders from [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?" he told them that was not the case

One was covered in his usual robes, which [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] had recognised instantly, and the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|other]] bore the crown of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]].

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] politely refused, citing his lack of vampirism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The offer would still stand.

The vampires explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was now acting almost like an Egg for their God and implied this was only possible because the Skyward Barrier had weakened. Once the food was all eaten, the women opened up a large black portal, similar to the ones [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] made. On the other side, a very confused tavern could be seen. Much to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s dismay, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began walking to the portal. They tried to tell them to reconsider their actions, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] rebutted, saying that if they wanted to, the vampires could've killed them by now, but they hadn't. The women explained that although they wished for their God, they wanted to do it without their friend dying.

Mordecai and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] ignore him and run out to join him. Mordecai exclaims that they both did stupid things in the past to face this together. The dragon lands in front of them and commands them to explain why they would want to travel to such a remote island. Mordecai replies in Draconic, saying that they wanted to come and speak to it. Korrigan explains that they know [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and know that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] was the last person to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] stares at them before narrowing their eyes at Mordecai. "You touched the crown, didn't you?" it said question. Mordecai apologises for doing so, as they had no idea. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that they can not let anyone leave the island because of that. Shocked, Mordecai tries to sacrifice himself to allow the others to leave. The rest refuse to let this happen, with Korrigan exclaiming that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] will kill one; they must destroy all of them as if they were a meal deal. Before anything else can happen, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears from a portal and uses some strange magic to freeze everyone but Mordecai on the spot with a large sigh. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that everyone here has to die, as coming onto this island is enough of a threat to the world. Mordecai claims they have enough audacity that they can't get through this, and nothing terrible will happen and swears on everyone's life. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] exclaims that swearing on these lives means everyone must fight them to the death, and either way - the Gods do not work like that. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] unfreezes everyone before going back through the portal.                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears and freezes them in place with the same magic as before. He looks at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] and then [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in dismay and exclaims that they better know what they are doing before stepping back into his portal. Behind him, they can see inside where a black dragon (possibly [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Kazzin\|Kazzin]]) alongside the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] and numerous other people hugely talking over papers.  The portal soon closes, leaving Korrigan fuming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]].

The man in the middle was presumably [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. the dragon on the right is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]], and the Harengon also looks familiar, but no one was sure where from. Near the fireplace was a large grate with holes and bars on it. In the box was a large fox with wings cowering in the corner. Korrigan immediately left the creatures out, leading to it rushing out and doing circles around the room like it was looking for someone. Korrigan asks who they're looking for. The fox explained that they were searching for their master: a large red dragon. Korrigan then asks what the fey creature is doing here, all locked up from the world. The fox says it wasn't being held there against its will; it's just nice and warm at the fireplace, and they're prone to getting lost. The fox introduces itself as [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]] and lands on Korrigan's horns to perch there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Once hearing this, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] immediately comes up with a theory that maybe the crystal chatting from the magic of magic wave could have caused Chenris' and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's memories to somehow fuse together, explaining the weird pockets of knowledge they have. Throughout this whole process, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is notably hesitant to call Chenris by name, referring to them as 'you know' or 'the old man'. With little to garner from the wreckage, they decided to head back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]] since it was getting late.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Suddenly a purple flame appears in the hand of a man wearing a black mask illuminating him in the dark to the party. Korrigan instantly greets him "Hi [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]!" But the masked figure has no idea who that is and simply asks if they are aware that they are trespassing in the palace of Dawnhaven. Mordecai accuses them of doing the exact same thing. Before the man replies, he clicks his fingers and behind him, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] appears kneels by his side and calls the masked man Master. Korrigan can quickly tell that something is controlling him. The man says that they have no idea what he is doing, for all they know, he is trying to save Dawnhaven for the world. Mordecai attempts to cast [[Admin/Spells/Dispel Magic\|Dispel Magic]] but it fails instantly.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | The man explains that he was originally planning to kill them but it is fortuitous that they have appeared as he needs someone to run an errand for him. Mordecai's eyes narrow in distrust while korrigan casts [Protection From Good And Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good) on Drache just in case something happens to them all. The masked man continues, stating that if they don't help him then they will be killed instantly. Looking at him carefully, Chenris understands that this man is at least 2 to 3 times stronger than Xekai and warns the party that he is not bluffing when he says that. The man wants them to sign a contract and then he'll leave them alone. pulling it out, the contract reads "You will do one task the contractor asks of you" Everyone is completely against the idea. To sweeten the deal he even offers 1000 gold each on completion of the task but refuses to elaborate what the task is until they have signed the contract. Drache seems ok after hearing about the gold, stating it could be used to help the OFC but is soon reminded of the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]'s contract and how easy it was for him to be manipulated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | With everyone eating some food the man leaned back and told them to sign the contract. He is completely unwilling to tell them anything about his identity or what he is doing, stating that he is under no obligation to do so. "I have been more than patient with you a lot. sign it or die a 1000 gold poorer." the man said. Chenris agrees to sign it, much to the shock of the party. "You don't want to die do you?" he says as the man conjures a purple portal above chenris and drops the contract onto this lap. Not wanting to move, he signs the contract with [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) and encourages the rest to do the same. The masked man seeing their hesitation, bargains that he will allow one question to be asked of him and he will answer to the best of his abilities as he is on a tight schedule. They brainstorm possible answers as they try to figure out the best way to learn as much as possible with one question. Some of these ideas are "What is your name?", "What are your intentions, good or bad?" or "Are you a part of [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?". With that last one is an ongoing theory of theirs ever since they say the purple mist, flames and portals since they're very reminiscent of Xekai's magic. While they are discussing, the man amends the contract to include their one free question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | With a more sombre tone, they now head for Dawnhaven. As the city came into view, they were met with an alarming sight: surrounding the city were loads of people in heavy black robes with black tendrils shooting out from their outstretched arms into the centre of the city. Surrounding them was a thick purple mist, Chenris sensed dark energies being used but was unable to understand their purpose. The magics felt familiar, but none could place where they had felt it from before. A few moments of silence passed as they also looked stunned at the scene. The silence was broken by Korrigan, who said, "Wait, doesn't that purple remind you of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

[[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Shocked to see the ever-mysterious cloaked figure, Mordecai asked what happened and why he was there. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] explained that when the door closed on her she went looking for help and found Xekai who offered to help them. Xekai spoke up, looking disgusted at how damaged and bloody they all were after the fight and opened a portal. A halfling woman soon walked through and asked if he wanted the usual, Xekai nodded and she fully healed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. They were now filled with questions that seemed to flow from their mouths like a vast waterfall, however, Xekai refused to answer any of them. Instead opting to say "At least you cleared that pyramid, a little behind schedule perhaps, but a good job nonetheless". Korrigan's questions about this schedule were only met with Xekai's refusal to answer. Korrigan then realises that Xekai was the one who killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]], otherwise known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' father. He tries to quietly point this out to Mordecai but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhears him and bursts into tears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This revelation shocked them into silence before Korrigan asked if he could at least tell them about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. However, his question is cut short by Xekai his face becomes twisted with rage at the mention of his previous faction's founder. When Korrigan tried to understand the source of the man's anger he simply opened a portal to a place Mordecai and Chenris recognised as the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Simply stating "To save you the travel, now go" Chenris ventured to the portal, thanking him one last time for the help before crossing over.

Korrigan makes a net of vines as a cushion in case he fell off the tower when he climbs up it later. The fall would defiantly kill him, but having some on on the inside of the tower would be super useful and he could tell Steve what was happening. Mordecai uses [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self) to make him look like a guard and sneaks in to the tower with Aidan. They tell the guard that they’re changing shifts and the guard is too exhausted to question it and leaves. Aidan breaks the lock and Mordecai reveals that they’ve come to save him. As they're trying to figure out how to escape with Steve, when a massive [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Kazzin\|black dragon]] arrives at the window at 3am and they all climb aboard, it was sent by [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], but the dragon didn't know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] | The Hooded figure found what he was looking for, Chenris knows that Xekai is using forbidden magic. Xekai is the one that killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. He knew Mordecai + Drache even though they were pretending to be dumb. He silences Drache because he found then annoying and prefers talking to Mordecai. Since he has everything he needs, he opens a portal and Mordecai "accidentally" falls in the portal and manages to pickpocket some of the pages that he had stolen. Xakei finds this funny leaving the group with a few pages saying "got ya" and one official [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
