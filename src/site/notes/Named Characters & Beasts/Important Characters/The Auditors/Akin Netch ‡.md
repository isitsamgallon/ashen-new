### Overview
Akin Netch, known as "the Faceless Savior," was a mysterious and revered figure as the founder of [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]. He rejected divine influence and adopted countless identities, never revealing his true face. His actions were guided by a belief in maintaining the world’s balance.

### Other Information
- Akin established _The Auditors_, a secretive order devoted to preserving balance in the realm, addressing both natural and supernatural forces. The Auditors acted as impartial agents, intervening in shadowy and decisive ways to maintain equilibrium.
- Under Akin’s guidance, _The Auditors_ were trained in martial arts, diplomacy, espionage, and magic. Akin shared a part of his essence with each Auditor, binding them to the mission of balance.
- Akin opposed the gods’ meddling in mortal affairs, recognising the chaos their presence brought. Despite his efforts, the gods sought to cross into the mortal realm, threatening the world’s stability.
- To stop the gods, Akin journeyed to Ember Peak, a mountain where the veil between planes was thin. In a final act of defiance, he revealed his true soul and sacrificed himself by leaping into the mountain’s flames. His essence sealed the gods away, restoring balance and protecting the mortal realm.
- Akin’s spirit became bound to Ember Peak, ensuring the gods remained trapped. His sacrifice solidified his role as the eternal guardian of the realm. _The Auditors_ continued their work, guided by his lingering essence, which is said to whisper from the peak’s flames.
- Akin Netch is remembered as the faceless saviour, the guardian of the veil, and the founder of _The Auditors_. His legacy persists in the ongoing mission to maintain balance, shielding the world from both divine and mortal disruptions.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | While korrigan went to buy some better armour, Drache suggested using the book's other feature to learn something about someone important. They doubted that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] was their real name, so they decided to write [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. The book revealed that when Akin sacrificed himself, there was one other person with him, who that was the book didn't say. Soon, Korrigan returned with Dragonscale mail armour[^4], to which drache thought they looked really good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Sitting at the desk was a powerful elf that glowed with golden magical power. his voice boomed with power and importance, and he asked how he could help[^6]. Something within [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew that this wasn't the real [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], but they didn't say anything allowed. Mordecai got right into it and asked about [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Haldir mused for a moment before explaining that he remembered [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] being built and revealed that he even knew [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]], although he admitted that he didn't know them well and had only chatted with them casually a few times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Korrigan asked if he knew of any other way of keeping the gods at bay. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] revealed that the only thing that could work would be a steady stream of influential people being sacrificed at [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], just like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]'s surface. It would be the only way to keep the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]] active without having to use [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | The person on the left seemed to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], and the dragon on the left seemed familiar, but [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] weren't sure where from. The man in the middle was presumably [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. the dragon on the right is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]], and the Harengon also looks familiar, but no one was sure where from. Near the fireplace was a large grate with holes and bars on it. In the box was a large fox with wings cowering in the corner. Korrigan immediately left the creatures out, leading to it rushing out and doing circles around the room like it was looking for someone. Korrigan asks who they're looking for. The fox explained that they were searching for their master: a large red dragon. Korrigan then asks what the fey creature is doing here, all locked up from the world. The fox says it wasn't being held there against its will; it's just nice and warm at the fireplace, and they're prone to getting lost. The fox introduces itself as [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]] and lands on Korrigan's horns to perch there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
