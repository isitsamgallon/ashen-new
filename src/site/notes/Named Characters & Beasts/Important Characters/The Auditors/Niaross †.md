### Overview
Known as The Grand Architect, he is a  member of the mysterious group called [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]. she was the original  creator of [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and is specifically mentioned as the person who created [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]]. 

They were later revealed to be Uti † and lived on the [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] guarding the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]] from the likes of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. They were sworn to kill anyone who entered the island to make sure Ebis couldn't sneak on. They were later killed by [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] when they travelled to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] to learn more about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. 

### Uti
Uti is a dragon and allegedly the last person to ever talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]] before [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] made contact with it. They were first named Uti and described in the book called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Loneliest Dragon\|The Loneliest Dragon]] where it said she lived in from a far-off land called [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]. 

### Notable Information
- They were first mentioned in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] in a very negative light. This was most likely due to him creating [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] that used to hold back the Gods - including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. 
- According to the [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|priest]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]], there is a specific way that you must talk to Uti or they will attack you on site. Unfortunately, this, and the knowledge of how to correctly talk to Uti, was lost due it to being contingent on a deal

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Sitting at the desk was a powerful elf that glowed with golden magical power. his voice boomed with power and importance, and he asked how he could help[^6]. Something within [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew that this wasn't the real [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], but they didn't say anything allowed. Mordecai got right into it and asked about [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Haldir mused for a moment before explaining that he remembered [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] being built and revealed that he even knew [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]], although he admitted that he didn't know them well and had only chatted with them casually a few times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and tells them to stay put before confronting the dragon. Mordecai and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] ignore him and run out to join him. Mordecai exclaims that they both did stupid things in the past to face this together. The dragon lands in front of them and commands them to explain why they would want to travel to such a remote island. Mordecai replies in Draconic, saying that they wanted to come and speak to it. Korrigan explains that they know [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and know that [[Uti †\|Uti †]] was the last person to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] stares at them before narrowing their eyes at Mordecai. "You touched the crown, didn't you?" it said question. Mordecai apologises for doing so, as they had no idea. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that they can not let anyone leave the island because of that. Shocked, Mordecai tries to sacrifice himself to allow the others to leave. The rest refuse to let this happen, with Korrigan exclaiming that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] will kill one; they must destroy all of them as if they were a meal deal. Before anything else can happen, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears from a portal and uses some strange magic to freeze everyone but Mordecai on the spot with a large sigh. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that everyone here has to die, as coming onto this island is enough of a threat to the world. Mordecai claims they have enough audacity that they can't get through this, and nothing terrible will happen and swears on everyone's life. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] exclaims that swearing on these lives means everyone must fight them to the death, and either way - the Gods do not work like that. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] unfreezes everyone before going back through the portal.                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | The battle with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] was short but decisive. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began by activating his Axe and began to hack and cleave at the dragon. Korrigan set up his healing spirit before shooting his bow. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took this time to cast [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste) on [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], causing the barbarian to move even faster than usual and hit with even more ferocity than before. Aidan tried out his new magic and cast [Hex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hex) on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] to Debuff them some more. Finally, Mordecai threw a firebolt at the dragon, only to realise that fire did not affect [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]. Letting out a huge roar, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] sprang into action and unleashed a massive barrage of flames that engulfed many party]] members. Everyone managed to survive, but Mordecai was severely injured. The fight wasn't over as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] attacked again, with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] doing a lot of damage as he found he could hit harder and faster. Mordecai used their Metamagic to make two strong Lightning [Chromatic Orb](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/chromatic-orb) that dealt much damage to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]], leaving its breath ragged. Korrigan was able to finish it off with some well-placed shots from his bow. [[Uti †\|Uti †]] fell to the ground dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | As this happened, a golden portal opened next to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body. A man wearing a golden mask, accompanied by a golden dragon, appeared through it. They looked at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body, their expressions unintelligible, before sadly shaking their heads, then left. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] ran to Mordecai, whose injuries had gotten the better of them, and healed them back to consciousness. Mordecai suddenly awoke confused and asked why [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would be so kind to them after everything they had done and said. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaims that Mordecai was in need and that it is right to help people and is confused at the idea that someone would help those in need. Mordecai is grateful but aware that this isn't the whole story and there is something more. He used the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] spell to ask if they knew Halfbie wasn't being entirely truthful, but they were off the hook because they healed him. They give Mordecai a smile as Korrigan and [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] come to heal Mordecai some more. At the same time, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] can't understand why [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] had to die. With [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] no longer concentrating on Haste, exhaustion hit [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] like a train as he leaned against a nearby wall to steady himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan calls out to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], furious that something like this had to happen and could have been avoided if the man wasn't so cryptic. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears and freezes them in place with the same magic as before. He looks at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] and then [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in dismay and exclaims that they better know what they are doing before stepping back into his portal. Behind him, they can see inside where a black dragon (possibly [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Kazzin\|Kazzin]]) alongside the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] and numerous other people hugely talking over papers.  The portal soon closes, leaving Korrigan fuming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | They all wake up on the beaches of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] a few days later when the captain and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] travel up the mountain to find them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] doesn't hear anything from them. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] all decided it would be best to go back up their mountain and check [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body and cave to see if they could find or learn anything about what happened or what might happen now that Ebis has the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. Travelling up the mountain again, they find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body fully decomposed and the one made out of solid [[gold\|gold]]. Concerned about the abnormality of the body decomposition rate and the [[gold\|gold]] skeleton, they decided to investigate. Mordecai suddenly remembers that they used [Speak With Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead)  from a wild magic surge from a fight a while back. They use it to learn more while Aidan figures out how to return the body to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to add to the nation's funds. The spell gave them five questions to ask the dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s corpse becomes quiet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | The person on the left seemed to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], and the dragon on the left seemed familiar, but [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] weren't sure where from. The man in the middle was presumably [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. the dragon on the right is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]], and the Harengon also looks familiar, but no one was sure where from. Near the fireplace was a large grate with holes and bars on it. In the box was a large fox with wings cowering in the corner. Korrigan immediately left the creatures out, leading to it rushing out and doing circles around the room like it was looking for someone. Korrigan asks who they're looking for. The fox explained that they were searching for their master: a large red dragon. Korrigan then asks what the fey creature is doing here, all locked up from the world. The fox says it wasn't being held there against its will; it's just nice and warm at the fireplace, and they're prone to getting lost. The fox introduces itself as [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]] and lands on Korrigan's horns to perch there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] | They return to the main library area where Korrigan says that Aidan needs to learn how to use his magic. He explains that it often activates when you really need to use the magic and while the magic does come from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], it is Aidan's will to do what he wants with the energy. This helps him calm down until he hears in his ear "or my will" from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Some time later, Chenris and Mordecai return from [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|Aeloria's room]] looking incredibly troubled, especially Mordecai. Chenris still looks incredibly angry, still in his summer form. Korrigan tries to ask what happened and all Mordecai can muster is a meek sorry. He goes on to explain that he was offered a deal and now looking back he really regrets not taking it. If he had, then everyone would know all about [[Uti †\|Uti †]] and so much more but it came a step cost of himself. Taking the deal would lead to him forgetting everything about himself and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|his mother]] all of him would be gone and would start from scratch. upon hearing this Korrigan is on verge of tears and gives him the biggest hug and explains that he received a similar deal but he at least got to keep most of his memories. Mordecai start to weep and Korrigan comforts him by saying it ok, if you think about it we didn't even know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] existed a few weeks ago and they learnt so much since then, we can always learn about the dragon the old fashioned way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Before going to bed Chenris decide to go to the library and to learn anything he can about what was said. He couldn't find anything about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] or the man who sacrificed himself and mostly just stuff he already knew about the Gods and [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. He did find [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Eldritch Curse of Eldermire Forest\|The Eldritch Curse of Eldermire Forest]] a popular fairy tale in the town. Afterwards, he returns to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to get some rest Mordecai is waiting for them as they get back and asks if they find anything interesting they both lament the unfruitful search and decide to get some rest while they can. Chenris goes straight to bed while Mordecai stays awake to watch Aidan make sure nothing bad happens. He sheepishly congratulates Aidan for not taking the deal and eventually goes to bed himself. Nothing happens during the night and they wake up and prepare to leave. Korrigan says a quick goodbye to the people in the tower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
