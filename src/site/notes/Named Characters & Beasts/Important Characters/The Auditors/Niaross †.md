### Overview
The Grand Architect. A mysterious member of [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] who was the primary creator of [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and is specifically mentioned as the person who created [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]]. They were later revealed to be Uti † and lived on the [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] guarding the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]] for the likes of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. They were sworn to kill anyone who entered the island to make sure Ebis couldn't sneak on. They were later killed by [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] when they travelled to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] to learn more about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. 

### Notable Information
- They were first mentioned in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] in a very negative light. This was most likely due to him creating [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] that used to hold back the Gods - including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. 
- They also seem to be connected to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|The All-Father]] due to their involvement with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] and their ability to drain [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|The All-Father]] 's power.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | Sitting at the desk was a powerful elf that glowed with golden magical power. his voice boomed with power and importance, and he asked how he could help[^6]. Something within [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew that this wasn't the real [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], but they didn't say anything allowed. Mordecai got right into it and asked about [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Haldir mused for a moment before explaining that he remembered [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] being built and revealed that he even knew [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]], although he admitted that he didn't know them well and had only chatted with them casually a few times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, Uti may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. Uti says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. Uti explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]], and Uti explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. Uti reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. Uti has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? Uti reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - Uti refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if Uti has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, Uti grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |
