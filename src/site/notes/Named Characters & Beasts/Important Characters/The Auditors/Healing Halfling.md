| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] awoke in an ornate-looking room filled with paper and books in stacks that reached the ceiling. The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] stood over them, doing her best to fix their golden bodies. It seemed she had already fixed their heads, allowing them to look around and talk. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] sat in the corner watching the scene with a clumb expression. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] awkwardly said, "I thought we were goners. Um, thank you. Sorry about earlier...Nice digs."                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] glanced at him as she tried to focus on the magic. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly watched, trying to figure out how the magic worked, before quickly pestering the halfling to explain it. She frowned at the young wizard for being quiet while they worked. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] apologised, but their stars made by [[Admin/Spells/Prestidigitation\|prestidigitation]] remained like a dog wagging its tail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] | Korrigan calls out to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], furious that something like this had to happen and could have been avoided if the man wasn't so cryptic. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears and freezes them in place with the same magic as before. He looks at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] and then [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in dismay and exclaims that they better know what they are doing before stepping back into his portal. Behind him, they can see inside where a black dragon (possibly [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Kazzin\|Kazzin]]) alongside the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] and numerous other people hugely talking over papers.  The portal soon closes, leaving Korrigan fuming. |
