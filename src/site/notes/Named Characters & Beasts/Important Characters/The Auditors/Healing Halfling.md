| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] | Korrigan calls out to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], furious that something like this had to happen and could have been avoided if the man wasn't so cryptic. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears and freezes them in place with the same magic as before. He looks at Uti and then [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in dismay and exclaims that they better know what they are doing before stepping back into his portal. Behind him, they can see inside where a black dragon (possibly [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/The Black Dragon\|The Black Dragon]]) alongside the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Healing Halfling\|Healing Halfling]] and numerous other people hugely talking over papers.  The portal soon closes, leaving Korrigan fuming. |
