| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis Ignithar]] began to rant about how kids these days had no clue about the magic they so casually wielded and wouldn't recognize true talent even if it hit them in the face. He was adamant that he was the best mage in the history of mages and claimed he could even defeat [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] if he tried. To [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s relief, Kaelis clarified that he wasn't related to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and was offended by the suggestion that he might worship a god he considered weaker than himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | Before they could say anything else, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] cleared his throat with a commanding cough before claiming that it seemed that the spell didn't work for everyone and that there was one more person who wasn't telling the full truth. As he said this, his eyes narrowed to the back of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Following the headmaster's gaze, they found him staring at [[[[Obeus Yelris\|[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] Yelris]], who looked to be on the verge of tears. With a click of his fingers, she let out a scream, she lost all the strength in her legs and crumpled to the floor. As she did so, it looked like a spectral being was being yanked from her. The being crumpled on the floor was small and bony[^2] but wore the same golden mask as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. "Ah, an [[Named Characters & Beasts/Aspect of Ebis Daro\|Aspect of Ebis Daro]], I presume", reasoned the headmaster. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' eyes narrowed in anger at the Empress, but before anyone could say anything, the aspect stood up and began readying a spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

She soon woke up, her expression one of shame and embarrassment before anyone could get a word in edgeways, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] looked at her, his expression unreadable as he said, "It seemed the empress had and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] in her pocket, care to explain why?".

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Coming to the end of their questions, Korrigan asked how many towers were needed to keep the gods at bay, especially with a lot of them falling. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] explained that only one is needed to stop them from entering the world, but with each one falling, people who gain power from the gods would grow stronger. Then the headmaster gave a warning that before long, all of them would fall, including [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] tower, it was not safe as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] already knew where it was. But before they could ask how he knew, Haldir laughed before revealing his true form: an incredibly old man hunched over. he had purple eyes and notably six purple identical[^8] that attached to his back, which kept hovering just above the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Down a few corridors, they walked through a heavily guarded gate and down a steep flight of stairs. until they entered a large and dark room - illuminated only by a pristine white pillar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | She confirms, saying it's uncharacteristically quick for the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]] since they need to still have a face for the nation, especially with how frequently new human rulers are selected. Korrigan tepidly asks if people like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or from the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]] can join in the running. She says that they would never have a chance since it is only the lords who can make a claim, and the mages guild is an international entity - leave all relieved. Before they head off, Chenris suggest leaving Drache and Aidan a note to explain what their plans are. Korrigan exclaims that he wants to try a new spell he learnt as he grabs a quill and paper and begins to write with the spell [Illusionary Script](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/illusionary-script) to encrypt the note so that only the party would be able to read it, to everyone else is "I am Aidan, and I am Stupid" as a prank on the man. The three all let out a big laugh before leaving their lodgings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | Chenris surmises to the party that this might be a dwarf who died during the human revolt at the beginning of the [[History & Events/Eras/5th Era\|5th Era]]. Speak With Dead gave Chenris 5 questions, his 1st was, "Do you know anything about this book?" The dead dwarf had no idea, but it looked like it came from the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]] Library. 2nd question: What is the Iron Forge explained that the entrance was down the side of the mountain. Finally, putting a name to the Ancient Dwarven Stronghold. His 3rd question: "What is this place?" the dwarf exclaimed this was their last haven. 4th question: "What can I find here?" the skeleton said, "The last of the Dwarves". 5th question: "Do you know Ebis Daro?" and it did not. With all the questions answered, the skeleton fell silent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | Annoyed that his authority was being challenged he replied, "No, I'm no longer with them anymore, I'm refusing with my own free will." This revelation shocked them into silence before Korrigan asked if he could at least tell them about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. However, his question is cut short by Xekai his face becomes twisted with rage at the mention of his previous faction's founder. When Korrigan tried to understand the source of the man's anger he simply opened a portal to a place Mordecai and Chenris recognised as the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Simply stating "To save you the travel, now go" Chenris ventured to the portal, thanking him one last time for the help before crossing over. He was soon joined by the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as they stood just outside [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], Drache waiting for them in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

[[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] explains that Ebis is a being that has been around for a long time and has worn many, many different faces. They don't know if Ebis and Lyrion are the same though. God does note that Ebis can be secretly bad even if he is very kind at the moment. Having answered all their questions, they say goodbye and Korrigan ends the spell and rushes to report everything he found out. He tells everyone, especially chenris about we had happened. Mordecai interjects and asks what is even happening, he feels very out of the loop and even left out of Chenris and Korrigan's little science group. Chenris is hesitant to let Mordecai join their group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The orb laughs and says he doing Chenris a great service, he would get a lot of information in exchange for forgetting something that has scared him so deeply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | Chenris decides to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] to ask questions about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]] and his disappearance. Ebis isn't able to help with a lot of details but points him in the right direction to find out more. After this, Chenris leans in and asks about him transforming in to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]]. Ebis denies knowing anything about this but after some pushing he gets up locks the door and transforms into the leader of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]], then quickly into Suicide bomber from the airship. He then switches back into to Ebis, unlocks the door and says "And no one will believe you". Chenris tries to calmly walk out and as soon as he is out of earshot of Ebis he runs like hell to his books to to figure out what he just saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

People seem to enjoy it and even chuck some coins at him. While this is happening, drache sits at the bar (which is unusual for this establishment), asks for a class of wine, and watches the crowd. After Mordecai finishes his first Ballad, he starts another about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]; however, he purposely tries to get a lot of information wrong to see if anyone reacts. Most patrons are sitting there, enjoying the music -apart from one, an older man who starts disagreeing with many things Mordecai purposely gets wrong. Drache approaches him and they begin to chat about the true history of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Drache learns a lot and thanks him for his time. The person says, "No, thank you. It's been wonderful to talk about such things.

At this very moment, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] walks into the room and summons a slowly moving elevator to take Mordecai up before flying ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] join to help him destroy it. Midway through this process, Mordecai finally reaches them and attempts to stop Chenris, but is completely ignored. Mordecai then tries to physically restrain him, but is stopped by Ebis, who is sent to the floor with a spell. Chenris is now very close to destroying the crystal, and Mordecai is desperate to at least get his attention, let alone stop him, and attempts to stab his leg. He misses, but chenris turns to see what is happening. Through tiers, Mordecai tries to tell chenris to stop. He doesn't know what he's doing - anything to stop him from going any further.
