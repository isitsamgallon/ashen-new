[[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been everywhere in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], "from [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the [[Locations/The Desert/Broken Ember Throne\|Broken Ember Throne]]," impressing everyone. they then revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been involved in many of the world's recent events, including [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], and even joined the hunt for a missing [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]][^6].  Seeing that it was getting a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] excused themselves, not before promising to get revenge for them if they ever ran into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]] on their travels. Before leaving, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] performed a funeral rite for them and sent the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]]'s soul to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s as he felt that this would be the best place for a person who loves adventure. |
