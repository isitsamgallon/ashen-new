### Overview
The Hunter [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. He offered to help them get to the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]] safely in exchange for the 20% of the gold the party earned from the raid. There seems to be more to him than meets the eye. For example, when Halfbie was copying a spell into their spell book they made a small error and despite having only just learnt the very fundamentals of magic, he was able to point out the mistake.  

### Description
#### Personality
He is a very gruff and stern man who doesn't want to talk very often. He also doesn't like to to talk or explain himself, adding to the party's suspicions that he is more than he lets on.

### Relationships

| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | From inside the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] watched the whole scene as they held their hands up to their face like looking through a frosted window. Aiden, who was sitting down near his bags, whittling some wood, was the only one to notice that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] was nowhere to be seen. When he finally pointed this out to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], worried for a sec that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] might have abandoned them, espailly has his pack and bow were missing. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly cast the spell [[Admin/Spells/Locate Object\|Locate object]], assuming that a seasoned hunter would never be caught without his bow. Their hunch was correct, as the bow was found relatively close by and wasn't moving further away from the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could not believe what was happening as their mind tried to process their experience in the void. They tried to make a witty remark, but all that came out was a single scream as their mind slowly unravelled. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] let go of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], also confused about what was happening. it stumbbled back and right into the sword of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]], who had snuck past everyone to land the killing blow. "Someone had to end it, and i'd didn't think it would be you lot"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | Everyone nodded; it was true they were having too much fun. They soon all returned to the tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] began building a fire to cook some food. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] also explained their sense of foreboding and their need to eat [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] coins. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] donated some coins from the share account purse. When that wasn't enough, they melted down some more coins and turned them into a milkskae for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], who happily drank it down. This still wasn't enough, so [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] was called a 'Coin Shandy' by mixing some of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s beer with molten [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. This wasn't enough, and now [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was slightly drunk as it went immediately to their head. However, it did help with their panic attack.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | Aiden hid his bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]], and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] had none to speak of. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]]'s food was ready; it was more 'deer'. They all ate some meat. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] took his meat basically raw, something [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] did without even being asked. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went in for seconds and soon found the meat almost addictive; [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] was glad to give him more food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]] | The battle fractured into a symphony of chaos. Three desperate fights unfolded simultaneously: [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stood alone before the hulking giant. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s battle axe wove a desperate perimeter against two stalking shadows. At the same time, across the field, Aidan and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] danced with a pair of their own. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], beset by three, fought for each breath. From behind the gnarled bark of a snow-covered tree, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] watched, their physical form hidden as their manifest mind and Eldritch Cannon extended their will into the fray.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]] | Seizing a moment, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] broke away, and Aidan vanished into a distraction. Their two assailants, now without prey, turned their icy blades on [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], cutting him down. The sight was a trigger. With a roar that ignored all tactical sense, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] charged to his ally's defence, weathering two brutal strikes meant to stop him. The stalkers swarmed, encircling the doctor and the barbarian in a tightening ring of steel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]] | While his companions drowned in the tide, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wielded a subtler weapon. A whispered *[[Admin/Spells/Suggestion\|Suggestion]]* slithered into the giant's mind. The massive creature blinked, its club slipping from numb fingers to thud against the earth. Unopposed, it began a slow, ponderous retreat. From behind the tree, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s cannon [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|spat a]] pulse of [[Admin/Spells/Mending\|mending]] energy toward [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], even as their magic lashed the stalkers. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]]'s shot whistled through the air, felling a stalker, and it stayed down. No unnatural reanimation. A clue, lost in the desperation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]] | The tide began to turn, but at a grisly price. Stalkers fell, their unnatural animation finally spent, but they dragged [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and then [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] back into darkness with them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] were next, shattered by the giant's returning club. Silence, thick and heavy, fell, broken only by the ragged breaths of Aidan. He stood alone, blade trembling but raised, against a giant and figures who refused to die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] let them off the hook, but still exchanged annoyed glances amongst themselves. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] beckoned the boy over to the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|corpses]] to analyse it. One of them still had the arrow that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]] had shot into it. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] pulled it out and, after a brief inspection, found nothing out of the ordinary apart from the metal being much shinier than he would expect from the typical Iron used arrows. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also couldn't come up with anything new, so they joined [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]], who had constructed a campfire to help warm everyone up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 54\|Session 54]] | Sitting down cross-legged, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to chant and, after a few minutes, summoned Leomand's Tiny Hut.

Opening the creaky wooden door, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly found the frantic [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]. When [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] saw [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] jumped at him, leaving the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]] to catch [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], something [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had become surprisingly adept at with other members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Once [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was safely put down from [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s princess carry, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained what [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had been up to, and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]'s offered to safely take [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] through the woods. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] agreed that this was a great opportunity, but they should check on the other. |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]] | After a brief explanation of how they got to be as they were, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] informed the last remaining members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's offer. Both of them thought it was a great idea. So they started making their way back down. Victor used Thunderstep to reach the Tavern quickly so he could get warm and eat a little. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began fighting in a way that reminded [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] of two kids fighting, with one accusing the other of something and the other retorting with mockery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

As they walked over, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used their magics to clean themselves up and make themselves look a bit more presentable. At the same time, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went to the bar to grab them both a beer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]] | As [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  watched them all clean themselves off, he whispered, "Bloody foreigners" under his breath, something that all but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] heard. None addressed it, caring more about hearing the man out rather than his boring racism. He began making his case as they sat down. They all agreed it was a fair deal, especially since we knew about the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]]. He confirmed this, but stressed that he would not engage with the raid itself and would try his best to help with some of the planning. He admitted that he only worked as a guard for the front gates that opened for the boats, so the inner workings of other parts of the fort weren't very well known to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]] | They cheered their drinks to confirm the deal before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] mentioned that, before heading off, it would be good for them to get some sleep and rest up after their fight with the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombies]] in the forests. At hearing this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's ears pricked up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
