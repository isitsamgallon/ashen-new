### Overview
The Hunter [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. He offered to help them get to the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]] safely in exchange for the 20% of the gold the party earned from the raid. There seems to be more to him than meets the eye. For example, when Halfbie was copying a spell into their spell book they made a small error and despite having only just learnt the very fundamentals of magic, he was able to point out the mistake.  

### Description

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 52\|Session 52]] | Approaching one of the hunters, he asked if they could tell him about navigating through the forests around [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]] explained that if you wanted to travel, there were two options: walk along the coast and risk being robbed by [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]], or walk through the forest. However, without a knowledgeable guide, they wouldn't last more than a day before they got lost and died, or were 'attacked by the...wildlife' |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 52\|Session 52]] | The hnter called to the bartender, asking for a private room to talk for a moment. The man behind the bar nodded to a small side room they could use. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]] beckoned him inside, holding the door open for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. Once inside, with the door closed, the hunter drew a dagger, pointing it at the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]].                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 52\|Session 52]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]]'s knife wavered for a second. The shock proved too great as he slammed the knife on a table and sat with his head in his hands for a moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
