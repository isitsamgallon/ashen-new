### Overview
The Hunter [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. He offered to help them get to the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]] safely in exchange for the 20% of the gold the party earned from the raid. There seems to be more to him than meets the eye. For example, when Halfbie was copying a spell into their spell book they made a small error and despite having only just learnt the very fundamentals of magic, he was able to point out the mistake.  

### Description

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began leaving the room to find the others; the explosions [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was hearing in the distance were almost definitely from the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Opening the creaky wooden door, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly found the frantic [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]. When [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] saw [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] jumped at him, leaving the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]] to catch [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], something [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had become surprisingly adept at with other members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Once [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was safely put down from [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]'s princess carry, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained what [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had been up to, and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]'s offered to safely take [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] through the woods. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] agreed that this was a great opportunity, but they should check on the other. |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | After a brief explanation of how they got to be as they were, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] informed the last remaining members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's offer. Both of them thought it was a great idea. So they started making their way back down. Victor used Thunderstep to reach the Tavern quickly so he could get warm and eat a little. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began fighting in a way that reminded [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] of two kids fighting, with one accusing the other of something and the other retorting with mockery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | Eventually, they made it back to the Tavern, and upon seeing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] return, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] pulled a chair up to an empty table and gestured for the rest ot join him. As they walked over, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] used their magics to clean themselves up and make themselves look a bit more presentable. At the same time, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] went to the bar to grab them both a beer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | As [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  watched them all clean themselves off, he whispered, "Bloody foreigners" under his breath, something that all but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] heard. None addressed it, caring more about hearing the man out rather than his boring racism. He began making his case as they sat down. They all agreed it was a fair deal, especially since we knew about the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]]. He confirmed this, but stressed that he would not engage with the raid itself and would try his best to help with some of the planning. He admitted that he only worked as a guard for the front gates that opened for the boats, so the inner workings of other parts of the fort weren't very well known to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | They cheered their drinks to confirm the deal before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] mentioned that, before heading off, it would be good for them to get some sleep and rest up after their fight with the zombies in the forests. At hearing this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's ears pricked up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took their time to explain the encounter they had earlier. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  explained that they were a known entity, most likely cursed a long time ago. Many Hunters in the area had become quite good at fighting back and even learnt how to kill them most effectively. It was now [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s turn to become interested, as they enquired as to how to kill them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  explained that if you killed/ damaged their bodies enough, then soon they wouldn't get up again, and they would stay down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | "Still..." [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] pondered, "Strange to see them come so close to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]..." His thoughts trailed off as he rubbed his chin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | Sitting back down, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] asked if, before they left, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  could help them hunt down two deer to give to the shopkeeper at Halo's emporium.

Between furious scriblings of [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s summoned quill, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  looked at [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and asked them to explain what they were doing and how it worked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s explanation was cut short as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  pointed at one of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s long calculations and simply pointed out an error to them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s whole existence shook for a moment as they looked down and immediately spotted a mistake. It was a fundamental mistake that only a novice would make, which only seemed to worsen the situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], cauatioly thanked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  for pointing out their mistake before continuing to write the new spells into their book. Once everything was ready, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] packed their things and began to head out for the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|golden fort]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  guided them through the forest. Before leaving, he insisted that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] obey every order he gave without question. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] shot a point glare at [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who, for their party, sheeishly said they would do their best to curb their curiosity. After the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] said yes, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  sighed, knowing this would be the best he was going to get.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 53\|Session 53]] | Walking through a large clearing in the snowy forest, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]]  suddenly stopped, signalling to the rest of he party to do the same. He suddenly "Get down!" before hiding away in the snow and foliage. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and Aiden followed suit. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], however, panicked and were unable to hide themselves properly.

With all the cursed hunters invisible, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] focused on the giant, buffing [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] to increasingly high levels with spells like [[Admin/Spells/Haste\|Haste]] and Enlarge/Reduce.
