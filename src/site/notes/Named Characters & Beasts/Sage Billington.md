He wished his parents, [[ Sage Billington\| Sage Billington]] and [[ Cumin Billington\| Cumin Billington]], could share in this experience. Intrigued, he asked [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] about other wonders they could show him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then launched into an enthusiastic monologue about chicken noodle soup. |
