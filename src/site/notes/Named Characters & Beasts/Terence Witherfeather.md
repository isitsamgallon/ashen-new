### Overview
Witherfeather is a powerful mage that was first mentioned by [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] as a way to break [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] out of this contract with the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]. It was revealed that Korrigan was also a part of the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] 5 years ago and Terrance helped him escape the contact when the effect weakened over time. He freed both of them by transferring the ownership over to a new party and then giving them the contract so that they were always in control. 

### Notable Information
- He start of the story he was chased out of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], presumably for freeing many slaves.
- Terence was then captured in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] and was forced to use his powers to help steal from people and in-slave them to Arwen. This is presumably where he also met [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]].

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]                 | In the basement of the mage guild, they found [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] slightly damp, smelling badly of fishing, playing card games with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]. Terence was playing solitaire while Winterbor did unspeakable things with a deck of cards, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] slammed cards on a desk, shouting, "GO FISH!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | In the morning, Korrigan approaches [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] (Mordecai secretly keeps an eye out to listen to their conversation); Korrigan notably refuses to break eye contact with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], intently staring at their purple eyes. He takes the time to ask them if they worship a god like he worships [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly explains that they worship [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], which shocks Korrigan and Mordecai. They explain that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] is the one who has helped them out the most that they can remember, so it only seemed right that they worship them. The two ask for some examples, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] helped them learn new spells and help them find a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|friend]]. However, when Mordecai asks who their friend is, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cannot remember, blinking blankly as they become confused. Mordecai tries to explain how [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] isn't all good as they offer information, but it will often come at a cost. They tell how Chenris was tricked into exchanging their soul for information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | They all decided that their best bet would be to go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]] and hire a boat to cross the waters to the island. There was briefly a discussion to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], who could probably just teleport them there, but it was deemed too much of a risk to make the long journey back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to find he couldn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | Next they go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], they find him smoking a pipe. Korrigan wants to know if there's anything they can to stop having their minds messed around with magic. Terrence tells a story of how ghost literally fucked his head. The wizard allegedly wore a hat to protect himself, He struggles to remember. he finally remembers that he wore the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Crown of Trues Sight\|Crown of Trues Sight]], lets the wearer see the world as it actually is, and not how people want you to see things. Terrance's prototype broke but the real artefact is out there, although he doesn't know where it is. it should be with a creature that likes to see what everything should be. Chenris had heard of the crown before, it was made by the goblins and it admits an aura that gives this ability to those around. He suspects either [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]] might be the owner of the crown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | In the basement corridor, Chenris take a deep breath and starts to prepare some instructions for the guards on what they need to do with Winterbor. Leaving the basement, he returns to the clerk who seems surprised that he is even alive and congratulates him on his safe return. They exchange a quick comment about the mad mage before chenris moves on to ask if they know where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] is. As it turns out, Witherfeather had been in the foyer the whole time and Chenris just had seen him. Approaching the wizard, he apologises for his rudeness and asks for his help in closing off the seas. Terrance agrees to help and allegedly knew [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] before he had gone mad stating that in his prime, Agolin was one of the great wizards of current era. Chenris vows to find out why he went mad and return him to normal and ask if Terrance new anything. The wizard only knew that Winterbor was working on some secret project with The Dean of the mages guild before he went missing and Winterbor went mad. The wizard hasn't been in seen in nearly 5 years and that is the unfortunate end of Terrance's knowledge on the subject. Chenris thanks him for the information and his aid in the war and apologises as he must run to prepare for the rest of the war. They bid farewell as Chenris rejoins the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in the war room. |

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] stabilises Aidan to make sure he doesn't die. Suddenly a goblin mage appears on top of a roof and then suddenly gravity becomes much stronger and all the party hit the floor. Chenris then had a realisation that this was Ancient goblin magic and used [[Other Information/Display Tags/Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic\|Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic]], as this was his second time using this feature, he was learning on the fly how to use it. The spell only works on one person at a time. He free Korrigan so he can use his bow to take down the mage but misses and has no more spell slots left. The mage also has now turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
