### Overview
Damascus Klyn is the former leader of [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. Having run the fort for a little over 20 years, he is known as a cruel and vindictive person who loves to watch people suffer.

### Notable Information 
- Towards the end of his tenure as leader, his troops started to lose faith in him when he sided with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] in [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], a battle they notably lost even though the odds were in his favour. 
- He notably captured and tortured [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] 's lover, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and took great delight in watching the first suffer as he forced the Dragonborn to choose if she or [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] would live. 
- He is an incredibly skilled fighter as shown when he seemingly effortlessly beat Drache many times in combat. 
- He was only killed when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|Vormomli Bronzehand]] betrayed him and shot him in the back of the head with a crossbow.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]     | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began to fall through a dark void, falling past manifestations of all his memories. Eventually, he landed on the hard, rocky ground. The landing was painless, but the air was hot and humid. Before he could explore his new surroundings, a huge plumb of magma erupted from the ground, rocketing high into the sky. Using the magma as a gate, the figures exited with a malicious stare in their eyes. He didn't recognise them at first until slowly he saw the faces he had faced in battles. The people he had killed in war he did not the cause of. Soon, more recent victims emerged as they stood frozen with fear. Soon, his worst fears were realised as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] emerged from the magma, a great axe drawn and poised for revenge. Suddenly, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] appeared at his side "It seems that no one is free of their past, are they?". [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] didn't, couldn't, respond. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] gently led him through a portal into a part of the forest that was more ethereal than the rest.                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Soon the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] catches up and asks what's going on. Drache introduces the man as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]], his best friend in the fort before he left. They also explain that they call Drache Stumpy because he is one of the smallest in the fort. Everyone found this incredibly hard to believe with how their friend is - easily towering over most of the people they've met on their journey so far. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] then notices Drache's missing leg and states it will be quite a shock to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] but he's sure that won't matter in the end. Mordecai asks what types of people typically work at the fort so he could start working on a disguise. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] explains that there are a lot of half-orcs and many of the other races. "They ain't too picky as long as you can fight and will obey [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|the boss]]" explains [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]]. Drache admits they don't treat people well at Tulan, unlike in [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. Mordecai explains that he has some spells that he can use to disguise himself, the half-orc laughs stating he'll need to put on a lot of muscle to fit in around the fort. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Just as they're about to head in that direction, Korrigan notices a door starting to creak open and ushers everyone into a bush to hide. Out the door [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|a strong-looking dwarf]] appear talking about how they "Might as well kill that Emerald Fort bitch, She won't give us anything" as they head into the throne room. Drache could not help but feel proud at how resilient his love had been. With [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]'s life on the line, they decide to split up. Korrigan will go grab the key while the rest will try to save [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] if she is in danger. Mordecai gives everyone Bardic Inspiration, while Drache gives Korrigan directions to the fort before they split up for their missions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Chenris states that time is of the essence and they should get back to the torture chambers as soon as possible, with none in disagreement they rush to the door. They quietly opened it to find no sign of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]], but the Dwarf stood over the maps, lost in thought. He was so deep in thought that he didn't even notice Mordecai sneaking past him to the torture chambers. Drache whispers that if he hears anything, Chenris will not be able to stop him from running into the room to defend his lover. Chenris says that if he does then he will do his best to hold the rear and stop the dwarf from joining the fight, however, for now, they have to be quiet so no guards get suspicious and investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Now deep in his rage, Drache charged into the fray. Calmly Klyn approaches the fight and swings his Great axe, leaving a deep gash in the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]'s chest. As if he never felt pain, Drache did not cease his charge has managed to swing 3 times in under 6 seconds, gouging out chunks of flesh. After some exchanges of blows Drache remarks, "I don't remember you being this weak". However, their gap in skills seemed to become apparent as Drache was now ragged and out of breath while [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] was only just getting started and soon Drache fell to his knees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Upon seeing their companion close to death, Chenris and Korrigan - two known for their disregard for social norms - [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step ) into the makeshift arena. Chenris casts [Command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command) on both of them to tell them to leave. It works on the dwarf but is countered by Damascus, who sends the command right back, but the elf is unable to leave due to the wall. "You should know boy that those spells don't work on the likes of me" snarled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] before turning his attention back to Drache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | "I'm sorry [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], you know my love for you is never-ending, Mordecai, he does not deserve this. You don't either. We will find each other again in this life, or the next" Drache says as his mind races to come up with a solution that does not exist. Once again Korrigan heals the man, saying, "Stand up my friend, don't take defeat so easily". Drache rises again, mustering his courage to swing his sword one last time. Just as he is about to swing the blade, Drache's vision is covered in blood and brain matter, as the dwarf fires a crossbow point-blank to the back of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]]' head, killing the man instantly. "I've had quite enough of all you bullshit Klyn. Now you all should leave while you have the chance" growled the dwarf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
