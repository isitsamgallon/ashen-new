| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Chenris wants Mordecai to return inside to grab the amulet that was meant to be their reward, but Mordecai refuses, saying they can probably get the equivalent amount of gold out of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ms. Adrei\|Ms. Adrei]]. She turns out to be the daughter of a nobleman in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], so Mordecai encourages her to rinse her old man out of all his money to help them and then writes a separate note explaining how she’s running away. |
