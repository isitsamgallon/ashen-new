### Overview
Halos Goodbarrel is the creator and founder of the incredibly lucrative and famous general and magic item store [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met Halos as a part of [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s [[Other Information/Money\|money]] making scheme in [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]].

### Description
#### Appearance
Halos is described as a very old looking wizard [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|Halfling]] typically wearing ornate armour. He is also described as having a wooden eye with the symbol of a Halfling holding a wooden hammer above its head inscribed in to it. 

#### Personality
Halos Seems to be a very cooky old man that has gone slightly made with age and wealth. He seems to be mostly kind and respectful to people, if a little vain due to the amount of [[Other Information/Money\|money]] he has, stating that 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] was merely a drop in the well. 

### Relationships
#### [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]
Chenris and Halos seem to have a strange or almost familiarly bond with one another that neither are able to explain. In reality this is because both character were used in a separate one shot before this champaign was even started. 

### Notable Information 
- This was [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] 's original character from another campaign. 

### History & Mentions

| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | Next, a halfling entered the room. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] instantly recognised him as the man from his singular wooden eye and large cane. He heartily greeted [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos Goodbarrel]] by name, who answered his greeting with a confused look as he asked what he was doing here.                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] admitted he felt the same, almost a brotherly connection to the man. They both pondered in silence before [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos]] handed over the bag of [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]. The man then turned to leave. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] offered some help, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos]] was fine, as some [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|kind man]] made purple portals in the corridor to help everyone get home. |
| [[Session Notes/Session 49\|Session 49]] | "Indeed, anyway, I'm going through my portal now. So, Oh, I wish you well on your [[Other Information/Money\|money]]-gathering scheme. 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] is not really a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|bothe]]r for me," said Halos as he turned to leave, "Ifyou ever in the need for For a good good old chinwag And some good old halfling beer come find me in [[Locations/The Maryhollows/The Maryhollows\|the Maryhollows]]."                                                                                |
