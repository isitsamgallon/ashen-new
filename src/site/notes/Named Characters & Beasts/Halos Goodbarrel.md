### Overview
Halos Goodbarrel is the creator and founder of the incredibly lucrative and famous general and magic item store [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]].

### Description
#### Appearance
Halos is described as a very old looking wizard [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|Halfling]] typically wearing ornate armour. He is also described as having a wooden eye with the symbol of a Halfling holding a wooden hammer above its head inscribed in to it. 

#### Personality
Halos Seems to be a very cooky old man that has gone slightly made with age and wealth. He seems to be mostly kind and respectful to people, if a little vain due to the amount of [[Other Information/Money\|money]] he has, stating that 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] was merely a drop in the well. 

### Relationships
#### [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]
Chenris and Halos seem to have a strange or almost familiarly bond with one another that neither are able to explain. In reality this is because both character were used in a separate one shot before this champaign was even started. 

### Notable Information

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | Next, a halfling entered the room. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] instantly recognised him as the man from his singular wooden eye and large cane. He heartily greeted [[Named Characters & Beasts/Halos Goodbarrel\|Halos Goodbarrel]] by name, who answered his greeting with a confused look as he asked what he was doing here. |
