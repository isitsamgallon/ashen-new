### Overview
Sometime before [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], Azel arrived in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] and began to stoke up racial hate, blaming the town's misfortunes on other races. He managed to stoke up so much hatred that they hung many Goblins ([[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] or not) and many of the foreigners. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]] tried his best to contain the hate but this only stoked the flames of hatred and caused riots. 

Azel owned and operated out of a hastily constructed church that operated as a soup kitchen to give meals and shelter to all who would listen to what he had to say.

### Notable Information 
- When [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] confronted him on his racist beliefs, Azel refused to call his beliefs racist and preferred to see what he did and said as helping the local community.
- Azel and some of his followers where murdered by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] when he was left to deal with Azel and his hate cult.
