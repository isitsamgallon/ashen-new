### Overview
Sometime before [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], Azel arrived in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] and began to stoke up racial hate, blaming the town's misfortunes on other races. He managed to stoke up so much hatred that they hung many Goblins ([[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] or not) and many of the foreigners. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]] tried his best to contain the hate but this only stoked the flames of hatred and caused riots. 

Azel owned and operated out of a hastily constructed church that operated as a soup kitchen to give meals and shelter to all who would listen to what he had to say.

### Notable Information 
- When [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] confronted him on his racist beliefs, Azel refused to call his beliefs racist and preferred to see what he did and said as helping the local community.
- Azel and some of his followers where murdered by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] when he was left to deal with Azel and his hate cult.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Worried about the state of the town and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]], they decide to go find [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] suggests that asking [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]] might be the best bet since they were meant to be working quite closely together. As they make their way through the town they find that the majority of people are wearing brown robes and hoods and that people seem very happy. upon closure look, Korrigan finds out that the people under the hoods are surprisingly not just humans, but many other races. Chenris also tries to get a closer look and (due to a bad roll) accidentally trips and pulls down someones trousers. he apologises profusely and returns the group muttering, "Cant do anything right it seems".                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Upon finding Bridges they find him in high sprites. After asking for Steve's whereabouts, he points them to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]'s church saying that "some exciting things have happened while you're gone." Now slightly worried they rush over to the church to find that they can hear a lot of singing come form inside. there are also 2 large guards wearing white armour outside. After deciding it was best to just approach them, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is asked what they want to do. Mordecai replied "We want to join in…?". The guards laugh and let them straight in. Entering the church, they're greeted a radically expanded church from before, now with a large space for a choir with singing and dancing being led by Steve who is wearing a brown robe decorated with [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]].                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | According to Steve [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]] was being very racist, like normal, so Steve just killed him and locked the rest of his, now angry, followers in a room with members of other races because steve heard a theory where you can use exposure therapy to help people understand. so he locked them in a room with a goblin, [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], elf and [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. he called "exposure therapy". [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], now concerned about the morals of the situation ask what are all the people doing here and they apart of a new cult now. Steve replies saying probably, no one is here by force in fact a lot f people are going out to other nation to spread the good word. Mordecai looks very afraid at the idea that people are going to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. HIs fears realised when Steve explained that no one had returned for [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] and [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. |
