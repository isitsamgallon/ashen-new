### Overview 
Keith Horrigan was one of the original councillors for the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|OFC]] and the only one willing to return and help [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] rebuild the nation after [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. In [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 12\|Session 12]], The Party left him in charge of the nation while they were away securing trade routes for the OFC. When the party returned to The OFC in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]], they discovered that [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|The Black Tower]] had been robbed completely of all its wealth, Horrigan had replaced all of the guards with his own and most of the tower's staff had been sent home early and he had not been heard from in weeks. This led the party to suspect he had made away with all of the gold. 

In reality, the tower had been robbed by the Dwarfs of [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] through secret tunnels that led to every part of the tower. Horrigan had hired his own guards with his own money to keep the city safe, he wanted to give the staff some time off during a particularly slow period. Horrigan himself was actually stabbed during the raid and nearly died underneath the tower in the hidden passageways after trying to stop the Dwarfs from stealing everything.

### Trivia
- Before The Party left on their diplomatic mission, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] tried to scare the councillor into being good and doing what they wanted. However, Horrigan was not scared whatsoever, even admitting that he had killed someone before so Chenris' "empty threats" did not affect him.
