### Overview 
Keith Horrigan was one of the original councillors for the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|OFC]] and the only one willing to return and help [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] rebuild the nation after [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. In [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]], The Party left him in charge of the nation while they were away securing trade routes for the OFC. When the party returned to The OFC in [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]], they discovered that [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|The Black Tower]] had been robbed completely of all its wealth, Horrigan had replaced all of the guards with his own and most of the tower's staff had been sent home early and he had not been heard from in weeks. This led the party to suspect he had made away with all of the gold. 

In reality, the tower had been robbed by the Dwarfs of [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] through secret tunnels that led to every part of the tower. Horrigan had hired his own guards with his own money to keep the city safe, he wanted to give the staff some time off during a particularly slow period. Horrigan himself was actually stabbed during the raid and nearly died underneath the tower in the hidden passageways after trying to stop the Dwarfs from stealing everything.

### Trivia
- Before The Party left on their diplomatic mission, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] tried to scare the councillor into being good and doing what they wanted. However, Horrigan was not scared whatsoever, even admitting that he had killed someone before so Chenris' "empty threats" did not affect him.

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 50\|Session 50]]        | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] awoke on some makeshift beds in the council rooms, with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]], alongside some attendants, watching over them with concerned looks plastered over their faces. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was the first to sit up. Nursing their wounds, they corrected their dyed fring, covering their left eye. They mumbled about how life wasn't worth it and how everything was terrible, clearly annoyed that their [[Other Information/Money\|money]]-making scheme didn't work as intended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 50\|Session 50]]        | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] rubbed their eyes before handing off most of the remaining [[Other Information/Money\|gold]] to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith]], instructing him to drop it off in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]'s vault for safekeeping. Tentatively stretching, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] conceded, "Well, at least there isn't some form of evil presence within the city so we can actually use this time to relax and heal properly"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] were very uncomfortable with this but soon saw there was nothing they could do but order them to direct them to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. The cult guided them there, with many rushing ahead to clear the paths and roads to line by the door like a king's guards would. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] what they thought about all of this, to which she said she thought of something very funny. before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could ask, they took control of the body and made them float in the air before letting a large wave of fire erupt from their hands. Horrified, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] had taken over and caused that because she thought it would be funny. They quickly ran inside before more people started staring at them. they were guided up the stairs and into the councillor's office, where [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] sat. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith]] had his feet on the desk while Steve, who was wearing a white and [[gold\|gold]] clock and holding a shepherd crook, was standing reading a document at a table. When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] walked, they immediately rose to attention. |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] congratulated him and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] on almost single-handedly running a nation, although not very ethically. After a lengthy lecture from [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] about ethics. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] demanded to see the Harpie. They were quickly led to the new dungeons where many people were sat in cells and forced to talk to other [[Other Information/Races/Races\|races]]. at the end of the cells was a room covered in blood where the harpie was kept chained to the wall. it threatened to kill all of them until [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained how he was going to free them. Once freed, it flew out of the dungeon incredibly quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | Before they could do anything, they heard a loud bang and a lot of screams. Almost on impulse, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ran towards the screams with exasperated [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] struggling to keep up behind them. Running onto the streets, they found a possessed [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], who must have snuck away at some point when entering the city, now possessed by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who was firing beams of energy aimed to kill as many people as possible with at least a dozen already dead around him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Very concerned with morality of the situation, Mordecai and Drache try to explain that 1. you should just kill people when they do bad things, 2. how do make sue he other races are safe in the locked rooms. 3. are people being treated fairly. 4. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are not Gods and they make mistakes which people wont take kindly to.  Chenris ends up commenting that the method clearly works it just needs to be tweaked to be more…humane. None the less they congratulate Steve on doing a good job with chenris saying they will come back and find away to regulate this operation and maybe invest money into it. He also ask how [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] is doing and Steve says he had disappeared about a week ago ([[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had been gone for 2-3 weeks in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]). as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] leave to investigate he wishes them good luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | once they enter the city, they decide to go to [[Groups & Factions/Ye Old Tavern Down the Road\|Ye Old Tavern Down the Road]] to get some more information on what to expect with the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] situation. Allegedly he had stolen everything from the palace, even the furniture. The are no witnesses since most of the guards weren't on duty, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|keith]] had hired his own guards for some reason. with nothing else left to do they go to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to get some sleep. In the morning, they make their way to the palace to find that there is a lot more of a verity of races walking the streets of the city, a testament to the work Steve had been doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This lead the group decide to travel to other nations to establish trade relationships, they decide to start with [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] since the enemy of enemy is my friend.
