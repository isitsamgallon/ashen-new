| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Just as they're about to head in that direction, Korrigan notices a door starting to creak open and ushers everyone into a bush to hide. Out the door [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|a strong-looking dwarf]] appear talking about how they "Might as well kill that [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]] bitch, She won't give us anything" as they head into the throne room. Drache could not help but feel proud at how resilient his love had been. With [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]'s life on the line, they decide to split up. Korrigan will go grab the key while the rest will try to save [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] if she is in danger. Mordecai gives everyone Bardic Inspiration, while Drache gives Korrigan directions to the fort before they split up for their missions. |
