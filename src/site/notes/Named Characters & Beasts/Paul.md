### Overview
A [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]] who runs the mines under [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]]. he seems to be quite a mischievous character as the first thing he did with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] was send them on a wild goose chase around the mines. He is currently quite concerned about the future of his town now that [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] has disappeared.

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] smugly explained their genius plan before they all went inside the mines, which were essentially the only notable thing in the town. Inside, they approached the first person they could find and asked him to point them in the direction of the man who ran the mines. He gave them complex and annoying instructions on how to get to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Paul\|Paul]], who ran the mines. After following the instructions, they returned to the same room they started in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] immediately connected the dots and greeted the man as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Paul\|Paul]]. he chuckled and returned the greeting.                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | After a quick chat, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Paul\|Paul]] revealed that there was an area of the mine that none could get to as all of the Automatons in the area guarded it, hurting and even killing people who got too close. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] convinced him to take them there, where they were confronted by an empty corridor. They then quickly entered a set of heavy doors at the other end of the corridor. On the other side was a ginormous circular room. In the middle was a large coffin ornamented with [[gold\|gold]] and intricate carvings. Around the outside of the room were many, many Automatons in what seemed to be a low power state. Approaching the coffin in the middle, they found it had three buttons on it. One red, one orange, one green. |
