| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | Examining the arrow, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] couldn't identify the poison but noticed that the name "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Dave McDuffin †\|Dave McDuffin †]]" was engraved on the shaft. Sensing some magic on the arrow, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over the analysis. However, they could only determine that it was enchanted. CXhenris, on the other hand, immediately recognised it from an old class at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] as a "Name Poison," a technique from [[Locations/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] that creates especially deadly poisons targeted at a specific person. The arrow would not affect anyone else and could not be replicated. Chenris shared this knowledge with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who explained it to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], much to their surprise. |
