### Notable Informationok about the fight with the wyvern painting him and his party in a much better light. The book was also written in such a way that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] were made to look pathetic.

He then used this favour to force Merek to investigate was was the traitor and messed up [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 07\|Session 07]] | They manage to convince the caption to go back to the guard tower where he remembers everything as if a spell had been broken. He apologises to the guards and the party but has no idea how everything happened and implores the party to look deeper, suggesting that they should start their search with the well as it is at the centre of town and go from there. While this is happening, Chenris and Korrigan slip into the captain's house and flick through the book only to discover it is an autobiography of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] 's 'adventures'. Chenris discovered it described the battle with the wyvern where Kal died. Instead this time it was changed so that Merek and his party did the majority of the work and claimed full credit for defeating the foe. In a fit of rage korrigan took the book and threw it in the fire before leaving to join the others. |
