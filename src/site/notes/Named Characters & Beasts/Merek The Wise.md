### Notable Informationok about the fight with the wyvern painting him and his party in a much better light. The book was also written in such a way that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] were made to look pathetic. 
- After [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] 's rebirth, he eventually found Merek while staying in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] and took him to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] s to strike some fear into him and to make Merek owe him. He then used this favour to force Merek to investigate was was the traitor and messed up [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]].
- Through magic, Merek was then able to identify [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] as the traitor.

| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Korrigan, ever the propionate of free will, is left to stew in his frustration over being forced to do something against his will. That and the ongoing frustration of not knowing who the trait of the group is, springs to action. Interrupting the group's strategy meeting, he declares he knows how to find the betrayer in their ranks and uses his fey pact to summon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] to his aid. Upon realising what is happening Merek starts to profusely sweat with worry and fear and timidly asks what is required of him. With a manic laugh, he tells Merek that if he uncovers who is responsible for failing the ritual and not banishing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], then is free of his debt. Merek is frozen in fear before being hurried off to do his job. Satisfied with the results of his actions he turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asks what preparation for the war need to be done. A moment of hesitation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] gets back to explaining the the dire situation the OFC is in. Even with [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] troupes, they are still out numbered at least 5 to 1. The Dawn has more airships, warships and heavy duty weaponry at their disposal as well. She also makes note that even though the OFC does have access to ships and airships, these are all small and/or merchant vessels meaning if they are all lost then their nation will be crippled in their trade capabilities after the war, even if they were to win. |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | In the morning, Chenris is going for a walk, when he runs in to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]]. Chenris immediately tells Korrigan and not Mordecai because Mordecai is “a buzzkill”. Korrigan is furious, walks down the stairs and says "Remember me? " and takes Merek to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s in a puff of magenta smoke and laughter. Korrigan said that Merck owed him a debt as his actions resulted in his death. He asks him for his name, to which Merek declines. After trying a few times, Korrigan gives up and even gives him a gift Merek accepts, korrigan starts to manically laugh as the gift was accepted, binding Merck into a fey contract unknown to Merck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 07\|Session 07]] | They manage to convince the caption to go back to the guard tower where he remembers everything as if a spell had been broken. He apologises to the guards and the party but has no idea how everything happened and implores the party to look deeper, suggesting that they should start their search with the well as it is at the centre of town and go from there. While this is happening, Chenris and Korrigan slip into the captain's house and flick through the book only to discover it is an autobiography of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] 's 'adventures'. Chenris discovered it described the battle with the wyvern where Kal died. Instead this time it was changed so that Merek and his party did the majority of the work and claimed full credit for defeating the foe. In a fit of rage korrigan took the book and threw it in the fire before leaving to join the others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] the Wise (Part of a small level 1 adventuring party made up of [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|halflings]]) pisses of the group by calling [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] weak as they keep bigging themselves up. This party mentioned how they were going to find dragons in the mountains near steelwick. The Group set up camp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
