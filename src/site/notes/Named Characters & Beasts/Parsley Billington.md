| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | Curiosity piqued, Dill expressed his desire to witness this larger land. He suggested riding on[[ Bit\| Bit]], and once clarified that Dill and his brother [[ Parsley Billington\| Parsley Billington]] were champions of feather racing, he excitedly hopped onto [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]]'s back while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used the Fly spell to elevate them high into the clouds.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | When asked about leisure activities in [[Locations/OFC/The Inchling Kingdom\|the Inchling Kingdom]], Dill admitted they did not engage in sports but highlighted their fishing competition, in which [[ Parsley Billington\| Parsley Billington]] had previously been the reigning champion until [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] arrived. Due to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]]'s popularity, they refrained from imposing a height restriction on the competition. The kingdom operated under a communist structure, allowing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]] to efficiently gather food, resulting in a culture of enjoyment for the Inchlings. |
