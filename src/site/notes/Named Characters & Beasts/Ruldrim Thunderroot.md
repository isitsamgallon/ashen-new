| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | One of them approached and thanked them, waking him up, and asked how the war effort was going. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained everything they knew from history books, leaving the 'Automaton' incredibly, saying it explained that he was actually a Dwarf called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] and had been to sleep in this room. Drawvern science, then let him live on in one of the automatons. The realisation then of his Ruldrim, if it had been several hundred years since the dwarf's defeat, then his family was most likely dead.                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | It began to weep, but no tears came from the Automaton's eyes. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] then asked if it would be possible for him to see his wife and child's graves. After a few questions, they realised that his wife and child were most likely the ones found in the hidden rooms in the Wyverns' cave. They lamented that that would be a long journey in the wrong direction. Ruldrim then revealed that towards the end of the war, his people had created a time machine, and although the time-travelling Party was missing or destroyed, he could still teleport this room if he was given the right coordinates. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | They soon teleported to the cave. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]]'s metal body slowly made its way through the ruins of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]], where it soon found the skeletal remains of a mother and child. The locket around the mother's neck with a picture of a happy family confirmed this was his husband and child. After a long moment of silence, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] turned to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], saying they had done him a great service and that he would be there for them if there was anything they needed.                                                                                                              |
