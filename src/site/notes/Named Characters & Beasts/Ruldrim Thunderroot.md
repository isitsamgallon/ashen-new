| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]] | Before they left, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim]] approached them with a small black box with a large red button on it. He explained that if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] needed to use the room to travel, they could call him using this box. Thanking him for being so thoughtful, they all headed off for the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|emerald fort]]. |
