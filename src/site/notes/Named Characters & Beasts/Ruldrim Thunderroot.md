### Notable Information
For some unknown reason, Ruldrim was told to rest in the room where he was later found by [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], with the knowledge that he would be awoken later on in the war when he was needed. unfortunately the [[Other Information/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] lost the war and were relegated  to [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] after [[History & Events/Battle of Earthgrog\|Battle of Earthgrog]]. 

Ruldrim once had a wife and young daughter before he was put to sleep who were revealed to be one of the sets of skeletons found in the section of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]] that was only accessible from the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]]. 

The room he was found in was once a part of ancient time machine. the element of it that could warp time has been lost but the room is still able to teleport.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]] | Before they left, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim]] approached them with a small black box with a large red button on it. He explained that if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] needed to use the room to travel, they could call him using this box. Thanking him for being so thoughtful, they all headed off for the [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|emerald fort]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | One of them approached and thanked them, waking him up, and asked how the war effort was going. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained everything they knew from history books, leaving the 'Automaton' incredibly, saying it explained that he was actually a Dwarf called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] and had been to sleep in this room. Drawvern science, then let him live on in one of the automatons. The realisation then of his Ruldrim, if it had been several hundred years since the dwarf's defeat, then his family was most likely dead.                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | It began to weep, but no tears came from the Automaton's eyes. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] then asked if it would be possible for him to see his wife and child's graves. After a few questions, they realised that his wife and child were most likely the ones found in the hidden rooms in the Wyverns' cave. They lamented that that would be a long journey in the wrong direction. Ruldrim then revealed that towards the end of the war, his people had created a time machine, and although the time-travelling Party was missing or destroyed, he could still teleport this room if he was given the right coordinates. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | They soon teleported to the cave. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]]'s metal body slowly made its way through the ruins of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]], where it soon found the skeletal remains of a mother and child. The locket around the mother's neck with a picture of a happy family confirmed this was his husband and child. After a long moment of silence, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] turned to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], saying they had done him a great service and that he would be there for them if there was anything they needed.                                                                                                              |
