| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The room was quiet for a moment before korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had met any [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]'s, to which the headmaster said he had met the [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]]s but none of the others. When asked, the headmaster also explained that he and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] managed to stay alive for as long as they did because of forbidden magics, but would elaborate any further as they were forbidden after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] votes 4-1 with Kal being the odd one out to hire the goblins. They also decide that contacting [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] isn't worth it. [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] just isn't close enough to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to be able to make in time and the Fleet is just too unreliable. With that chenris motions for some guards to bring back the goblins and they agree to a deal.

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Korrigan, ever the propionate of free will, is left to stew in his frustration over being forced to do something against his will. That and the ongoing frustration of not knowing who the trait of the group is, springs to action. Interrupting the group's strategy meeting, he declares he knows how to find the betrayer in their ranks and uses his fey pact to summon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] to his aid. Upon realising what is happening Merek starts to profusely sweat with worry and fear and timidly asks what is required of him. With a manic laugh, he tells Merek that if he uncovers who is responsible for failing the ritual and not banishing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], then is free of his debt. Merek is frozen in fear before being hurried off to do his job. Satisfied with the results of his actions he turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asks what preparation for the war need to be done. A moment of hesitation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] gets back to explaining the the dire situation the OFC is in. Even with [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] troupes, they are still out numbered at least 5 to 1. The Dawn has more airships, warships and heavy duty weaponry at their disposal as well. She also makes note that even though the OFC does have access to ships and airships, these are all small and/or merchant vessels meaning if they are all lost then their nation will be crippled in their trade capabilities after the war, even if they were to win. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] then turns to Korrigan and asks if that is all. Korrigan, clearly still angry at Chenris's betrayal, says "No, make him suffer". With glee on her and a chorus of laughter from the fey around them he says "You elf, you must help korrigan here when the time is right. You must also deal with the same magical instability or lose our support entirely!". Without any options, Chenris agrees and the whole court erupts in laugher that is almost deafening to the 3 of them. As they are leaving, the two confront korrigan for his stupidity, with Mordecai exclaiming "Do you even know what you've done?!?" Korrigan apologises, saying he had no idea she would be so unkind. Chenris chips in saying that its happened now and we finally have a chance at winning this war. With Mordecai unwilling to explain his outburst of fury and tears any further, falls to the back of the group with his emotions all but seeping out of him as they return to the war room. Declaring they now have enough troupes for the war, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] lets out a large sigh of relief. Everyone now thoroughly exhausted from a day of strategy, revelation and negotiations they turn to go to bed. With little else to do and some still stunned from the revelation, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] join him and go to bed.                                                                                                                                                   |

During the night [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]' cloak was stolen by [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]]. this infuriates chenris cause him to explode at Aidan for stealing his stuff, to which the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] try to confront him about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. He says "touche" and heads over the the council room, where they find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] waiting for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Satisfied with the results of his actions he turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asks what preparation for the war need to be done. A moment of hesitation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] gets back to explaining the the dire situation the OFC is in. Even with [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] troupes, they are still out numbered at least 5 to 1. The Dawn has more airships, warships and heavy duty weaponry at their disposal as well. She also makes note that even though the OFC does have access to ships and airships, these are all small and/or merchant vessels meaning if they are all lost then their nation will be crippled in their trade capabilities after the war, even if they were to win. |

Korrigan, clearly still angry at Chenris's betrayal, says "No, make him suffer". With glee on her and a chorus of laughter from the fey around them he says "You elf, you must help korrigan here when the time is right. You must also deal with the same magical instability or lose our support entirely!". Without any options, Chenris agrees and the whole court erupts in laugher that is almost deafening to the 3 of them. As they are leaving, the two confront korrigan for his stupidity, with Mordecai exclaiming "Do you even know what you've done?!?" Korrigan apologises, saying he had no idea she would be so unkind. Chenris chips in saying that its happened now and we finally have a chance at winning this war. With Mordecai unwilling to explain his outburst of fury and tears any further, falls to the back of the group with his emotions all but seeping out of him as they return to the war room. Declaring they now have enough troupes for the war, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] lets out a large sigh of relief. Everyone now thoroughly exhausted from a day of strategy, revelation and negotiations they turn to go to bed. With little else to do and some still stunned from the revelation, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] join him and go to bed.                                                                                                                                                   |
