### Overview
Genevieve was the former leader of [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] and a known [[Other Information/Perpetual\|Perpetual]], being 334 years old when she died whilst being [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]]. Before her death, she ran the fort for over 200 years but her family have controlled the fort for 1000s of years. 

She fought in [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] as a part of [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] and was considered a fair leader, but extremely [[Other Information/Money\|money]]-driven. 

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met her while they were exploring [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] looking for allies. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] was happy to help for the right price and joined the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]]'s side during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. Here the conditions for [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] joining the war:
- Large sum of [[Other Information/Money\|money]] 
- Full control of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]]'s military
- A portion of the protection and mafia money

### Perpetual Nature
(o:: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]]'s long lifespan was a result of a crystal mentioned to be in her office. He was trying to direct [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to investigate further but they became fixated on the find her her lover instead. Before he could get them back on track they became incredibly drunk and awoke in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]].)

### Other Information & Trivia
- When the party first met her, she seemed to already be aware of [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] even though he had never been to [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. She warned him of being known as a deserter and nearly punished him herself, despite him belonging to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. Instead she just wished for the safe rescue of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]].
- [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] heard a rumour she was dating a troll.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | Standing at the threshold of the Wyverns Cave, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] paused to get their bearings and figure out where they needed to go. The Tour Du Ashen's hands accounted for them discovering a teleporting dwarven room and venturing back to the Wyverns Cave. Studying the map closely and referring to an old book they found recently, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they travel to The [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]], not only would it give them easy access to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], but it would give them all a chance to catch up with an [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]] business partner and to learn what happened after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death [^1]. The rest all agreed and began preparations to head off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | As the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] hung back, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nervously stayed put. He wanted to ask who was currently running the fort after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death. The guards explained that after her heroic death, her son, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Kaes\|Kaes]], took over. Unlike his mother, he is a very intelligent ruler, much colder and calculating. The conversation eventually turned to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], where guards admitted they had heard how bad it had gotten, and its reputation had been run into the ground. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] chimed in, asking the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]]'s opinion on unions. The guards explained they didn't have one as they were all family at the fort, leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uneasy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | With their conversation concluded, they entered the fort. It was much emptier than when they last visited, presumably because many of them were at the [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]]. Walking through the streets, they eventually came across a freshly made marble statue of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tugged at [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s sleeve and asked if he could make some flowers to lay at the statue. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] sadly explained he couldn't do it at the moment as he didn't have the spell prepared, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] could probably. The druid quickly stepped up and cast the spell Plant Growth, causing a field of flowers to bloom around the statue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | While the others had a moment of silence, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly got out the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and wrote in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s name. Ink slowly seeped into the ancient pages before being replaced with text that read, 'When [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] died, she was 334'. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] saw [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reading the book and peeked at the page before becoming amazed at how long [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] had been alive. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] nodded, saying that it had alluded them for a while now. A few of the [[Human\|humans]] involved in [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]] were hundreds of years old, even though they were only [[human\|human]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed in their notes that they had been calling these people Perpetuals. So far, they had listed Galen Verik, Caden Steelbreaker and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] as all pertutals, with only Galen having a somewhat concrete explanation [^2].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wondered if they had a record room to look through to learn more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] assumed they probably did, as most places would have some form of central records, although they probably wouldn't be super detailed. They soon found the library, but it was primarily financial information and basic troop movement. There wasn't a lot about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]; the earliest records of her began a few years after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they find someone who knew her well and ask.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | None of them knew who the second in command would be. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained that during his time at Tulan Fort, there was a rumour that she had a lover who looked like a troll. He explained that they probably could trust the troll part, but she probably did have a lover. Upon hearing this, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] immediately became very interested and started trying to picture the type of person [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s lover would be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] surmised that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s girlfriend would most likely be a very Femme Lesbian, probably quite disorganised and with a bubbly personality. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] built on this assumption, thinking that the best place to find them would be in some bar or mess hall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that man Femme lesbians are quite messy when they drink. So they suggested starting a drinking contest. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained he would use Elemenism to give [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s entrance some dramatic effect, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] would start the contest. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan would then watch for anyone who could be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s lover. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] thought to themselves before getting out their spell book. After muttering a few words, a glowing orb began to take the form of an Elven face. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then commanded it to fly into the mess hall with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], fly up to the roof, and give [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a top-down view of everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The room was quiet for a moment before korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had met any [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]'s, to which the headmaster said he had met the [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]]s but none of the others. When asked, the headmaster also explained that he and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] managed to stay alive for as long as they did because of forbidden magics, but would elaborate any further as they were forbidden after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | After a brief conversation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]], they can't decide weather to hire the goblins so they put it up to a vote with Chenris noting that they can use the goblin troupes as sacrificial pawns in the fight to make them easier to deal with later on. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] votes 4-1 with Kal being the odd one out to hire the goblins. They also decide that contacting [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] isn't worth it. [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] just isn't close enough to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to be able to make in time and the Fleet is just too unreliable. With that chenris motions for some guards to bring back the goblins and they agree to a deal. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had to physically force Korrigan to sign the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Korrigan, ever the propionate of free will, is left to stew in his frustration over being forced to do something against his will. That and the ongoing frustration of not knowing who the trait of the group is, springs to action. Interrupting the group's strategy meeting, he declares he knows how to find the betrayer in their ranks and uses his fey pact to summon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] to his aid. Upon realising what is happening Merek starts to profusely sweat with worry and fear and timidly asks what is required of him. With a manic laugh, he tells Merek that if he uncovers who is responsible for failing the ritual and not banishing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], then is free of his debt. Merek is frozen in fear before being hurried off to do his job. Satisfied with the results of his actions he turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asks what preparation for the war need to be done. A moment of hesitation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] gets back to explaining the the dire situation the OFC is in. Even with [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] troupes, they are still out numbered at least 5 to 1. The Dawn has more airships, warships and heavy duty weaponry at their disposal as well. She also makes note that even though the OFC does have access to ships and airships, these are all small and/or merchant vessels meaning if they are all lost then their nation will be crippled in their trade capabilities after the war, even if they were to win. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] then turns to Korrigan and asks if that is all. Korrigan, clearly still angry at Chenris's betrayal, says "No, make him suffer". With glee on her and a chorus of laughter from the fey around them he says "You elf, you must help korrigan here when the time is right. You must also deal with the same magical instability or lose our support entirely!". Without any options, Chenris agrees and the whole court erupts in laugher that is almost deafening to the 3 of them. As they are leaving, the two confront korrigan for his stupidity, with Mordecai exclaiming "Do you even know what you've done?!?" Korrigan apologises, saying he had no idea she would be so unkind. Chenris chips in saying that its happened now and we finally have a chance at winning this war. With Mordecai unwilling to explain his outburst of fury and tears any further, falls to the back of the group with his emotions all but seeping out of him as they return to the war room. Declaring they now have enough troupes for the war, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] lets out a large sigh of relief. Everyone now thoroughly exhausted from a day of strategy, revelation and negotiations they turn to go to bed. With little else to do and some still stunned from the revelation, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] join him and go to bed.                                                                                                                                                   |
