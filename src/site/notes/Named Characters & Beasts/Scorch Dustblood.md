| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 50\|Session 50]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to comfort his party mate to no avail, as it just made Halfie rant about how it would have been fine if [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|someone]] hadn't decided to antagonise [[Named Characters & Beasts/Scorch Dustblood\|\]]. The two were interrupted as a loud crackle of thunder could be heard from [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]'s bed as he opened a thunder door and teleported away. |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]] | Finally, a Fire Genasi entered the room and immediately pointed a blade at Victor's throat. They introduced themselves as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Scorch Dustblood\|Scorch Dustblood]], a name Victor knew well as a powerful family in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] greeted them rudely, gesturing at the sword, "Well met, friend, that'll cost you 3000 [[Other Information/Money\|gold]]."                                                         |
