### Overview
First encountered in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] 's office in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]. An Aspect is almost like an magical copy of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] that he sends to try and kill [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Due to it being a magical construct, killing it does not kill [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and it also as the ability to shapeshift into other forms when it is damaged too much.
