### Overview
First encountered in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] 's office in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]. An Aspect is almost like an magical copy of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] that he sends to try and kill [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Due to it being a magical construct, killing it does not kill [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and it also as the ability to shapeshift into other forms when it is damaged too much.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]] | Before they could say anything else, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] cleared his throat with a commanding cough before claiming that it seemed that the spell didn't work for everyone and that there was one more person who wasn't telling the full truth. As he said this, his eyes narrowed to the back of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Following the headmaster's gaze, they found him staring at [[[[Obeus Yelris\|[[Obeus Yelris]] Yelris]], who looked to be on the verge of tears. With a click of his fingers, she let out a scream, she lost all the strength in her legs and crumpled to the floor. As she did so, it looked like a spectral being was being yanked from her. The being crumpled on the floor was small and bony[^2] but wore the same golden mask as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. "Ah, an [[Named Characters & Beasts/Aspect of Ebis Daro\|Aspect of Ebis Daro]], I presume", reasoned the headmaster. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow โก\|Chenris]]' eyes narrowed in anger at the Empress, but before anyone could say anything, the aspect stood up and began readying a spell. |
