| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Next they go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], they find him smoking a pipe. Korrigan wants to know if there's anything they can to stop having their minds messed around with magic. Terrence tells a story of how ghost literally fucked his head. The wizard allegedly wore a hat to protect himself, He struggles to remember. he finally remembers that he wore the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Crown of Trues Sight\|Crown of Trues Sight]], lets the wearer see the world as it actually is, and not how people want you to see things. Terrance's prototype broke but the real artefact is out there, although he doesn't know where it is. it should be with a creature that likes to see what everything should be. Chenris had heard of the crown before, it was made by the goblins and it admits an aura that gives this ability to those around. He suspects either [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]] might be the owner of the crown. |
