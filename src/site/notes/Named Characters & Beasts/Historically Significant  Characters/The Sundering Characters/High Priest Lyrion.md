# The Teachings of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]]

### On Devotion
L.1. True devotion to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is found in the flames of sacrifice. To give oneself wholly to the Cleansing Flame is to embrace purity and rebirth. The [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] are the pinnacle of this devotion, eternal servants of our god's will.

### On Purification
The world is tainted by corruption and sin. Only through fire can it be cleansed. We, [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]], are the instruments of this purification. Our duty is to spread the holy fire, to burn away the old and make way for the new.

### On the Return of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]
[[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] 's return is inevitable. Though his physical form was struck down, his essence remains eternal. We must remain vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to welcome him back. In his return, the world shall be reborn in divine fire.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] opens the door a little further and finds that the red cloaks don't have bodies; they are just large motes of flames. Many more floating flames were hovering around the room, keeping it bright. The Firesoul Greatsword was floating a few feet off the ground in the middle. Mordecai is highly tempted to grab the blade as the voice tells them to claim their prize. Mordecai resists the urea but becomes irritated when the voice mocks him for not figuring out who they're being possessed by. Korrigan says "Hi Ebis" on a whim to the voice. The voice laughs as it exclaims that she is way better than that pretender. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks if the voice is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]]; she says she is much better than that fool, saying, "They are nought but a twinkle in my eye". The voice begins to tease them that being in Mordecai's mind is very fun as they get to know so much about his past, including that letter to their father and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle's death]]. Mordecai tells the voice to get out of their head that they don't need an army and they don't need any help. The voice laughs manically as they explain that all of their efforts are pitiful compared to the power of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. Mordecai was also told not to worry about it, as although they can't control Mordecai's body yet, soon they will, and it won't matter. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]] | Korrigan then asks about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and explains his theory about how Ebis might be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]]. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] explains that Ebis is a being that has been around for a long time and has worn many, many different faces. They don't know if Ebis and Lyrion are the same though. God does note that Ebis can be secretly bad even if he is very kind at the moment. Having answered all their questions, they say goodbye and Korrigan ends the spell and rushes to report everything he found out. He tells everyone, especially chenris about we had happened. Mordecai interjects and asks what is even happening, he feels very out of the loop and even left out of Chenris and Korrigan's little science group. Chenris is hesitant to let Mordecai join their group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Clearly exhausted from all the conflicting emotions he had been feeling today eventually falls into a deep Trance leaving Aidan and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to watch. Aidan asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about deals with Gods. She Confesses that she isn't very familiar with them, she just knows they're not a good idea. Aidan says its a bit too late for that and asks if Gods have been known to grant people power in return for deals. She sighs and explains that the Gods have been known to do this and explains that there was legend of even [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] giving special powers to some kind of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|high priest]] back during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. Aidan reveals he made a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] advises that too much of a Gods influence can be "ill advised". The rest of the watch goes unhindered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
