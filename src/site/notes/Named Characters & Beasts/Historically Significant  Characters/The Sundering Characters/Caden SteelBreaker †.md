### Other Information & History
- After [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]] found herself trapped in a love triangle with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Ultimately she falls for Caden but it's considered Taboo to marry humans in Elvin culture so she promises to love Caden forever in secret.
- Soon after she returned to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], she was known to constantly leave the palace at night time and only return in the early hours of the morning looking incredibly drained. Over time she became so weak that she passed away. 
- This explosion also caused a wyvern to attack the area. During the chaos of the attack, no one noticed when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] secretly caused the tree to fall onto Caden's body, killing him. His death was verified and his body was brought back to Blackwall.
- Later on, the party adventured out to [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] and met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] who revealed that Caden was originally a part of The Dawn but defected to help from the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. It was also revealed that he fought in [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] 250 years ago.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed that they wanted to earn money to support their family in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]]. Although they had limited financial resources, they shared what little they had. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] mentioned her own tragic family history, stating that her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] had passed away shortly after her birth, and she did not know her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|father]] until after his death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Shocked to see the ever-mysterious cloaked figure, Mordecai asked what happened and why he was there. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] explained that when the door closed on her she went looking for help and found Xekai who offered to help them. Xekai spoke up, looking disgusted at how damaged and bloody they all were after the fight and opened a portal. A halfling woman soon walked through and asked if he wanted the usual, Xekai nodded and she fully healed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. They were now filled with questions that seemed to flow from their mouths like a vast waterfall, however, Xekai refused to answer any of them. Instead opting to say "At least you cleared that pyramid, a little behind schedule perhaps, but a good job nonetheless". Korrigan's questions about this schedule were only met with Xekai's refusal to answer. Korrigan then realises that Xekai was the one who killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]], otherwise known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' father. He tries to quietly point this out to Mordecai but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhears him and bursts into tears. |

Korrigan manages to get a small look inside and everything seems calm. There aren't that many people on the streets, notably less than when they were last there. They decide to go in and have a look, there are no guards so getting to the tavern is pretty easy. Looking inside they see the Halfling barkeep still behind the bar doing their normal work and no one else around them. Chenris and Korrigan enter, and the barkeep welcomes them in. Mordecai asks how things are going. She notes that not many people walk through Foxtail anymore with the Pyramid]] blocking a lot of the trade and the goblins being murdered. According to her, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] came into town during the war and killed most of the goblins on their way to fight. The party promises to help the best they can and move on.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Mordecai finds a lose brick and behind it is the back of a canvas. He realises that he is behind the portrait of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]'s room [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] manage to hear him after shouting they and join them in the office and work on getting him out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
