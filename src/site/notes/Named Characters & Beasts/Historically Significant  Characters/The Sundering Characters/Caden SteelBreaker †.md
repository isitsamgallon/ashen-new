Ultimately she falls for Caden but it's considered Taboo to marry humans in Elvin culture so she promises to love Caden forever in secret.

His death was verified and his body was brought back to Blackwall.

Xekai is the one that killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. He knew Mordecai + Drache even though they were pretending to be dumb. He silences Drache because he found then annoying and prefers talking to Mordecai. Since he has everything he needs, he opens a portal and Mordecai "accidentally" falls in the portal and manages to pickpocket some of the pages that he had stolen. Xakei finds this funny leaving the group with a few pages saying "got ya" and one official [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
