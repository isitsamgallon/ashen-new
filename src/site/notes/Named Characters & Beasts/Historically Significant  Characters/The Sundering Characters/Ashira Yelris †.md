### Overview
Ashira is the previous Emperor of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], reigning during the time of [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]], fighting with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. After the war, she found herself in a love triangle with Caden and Galen. She ultimately falls for Caden, but relationships between [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Humans]] and [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] are considered, so she promises to love Caden forever in secret.

### Death
Soon after she returned to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], she was known to leave the palace constantly at night and only return in the early morning, looking incredibly drained. Over time, she became so weak that she passed away. Before she died, she gave birth to a daughter called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]].

(o:: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] revealed that Ashira died because she gave up the emerald swan amulet when her daughter was born. The amulet was keeping her alive.)

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], recalling her own family background, inquired about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s parents. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed that they wanted to earn money to support their family in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]]. Although they had limited financial resources, they shared what little they had. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] mentioned her own tragic family history, stating that her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] had passed away shortly after her birth, and she did not know her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|father]] until after his death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] have just met up outside the palace and decided that their best course of action is to leave the city before anyone finds out that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] has gone missing. As they walk through [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] talks to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about the stars and tells the folktales of how they came to be through great warriors and researchers. One of these stories talks about friends leaving [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] feeling sad since she has never had friends due to not being allowed out of the palace. Mordecai says that ok because [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] will be her friends and she is overjoyed at the fact that she has made her first friends. She tries to give them money for this but Mordecai and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] refuse since that is not what friends are about (instead they say it's about trade deals between nations). However, she insists on giving a gift but laments that the only thing she has on her is a special [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Emerald Swan Amulet\|Amulet]] her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] gave her. Reading from a book she tells [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] the story of the amulet: |
