### Overview
Ashira is the previous Emperor of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], reigning during the time of [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] , fighting with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. After the war, she found herself in a love triangle with Caden and Galen. She ultimately fell for Caden but relationships between Humans and [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] are considered so she promised to love Caden forever in secret.

Soon after she returned to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], she was known to constantly leave the palace at night time and only return in the early hours of the morning looking incredibly drained. Over time she became so weak that she passed away. Before she died, she gave birth to a daughter called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]].
