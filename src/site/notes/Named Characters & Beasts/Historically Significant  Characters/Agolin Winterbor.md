### Overview
Winterbor was the mad wizard that Chenris Tallfellow encountered during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the War for the OFC's Freedom]]. He was last seen in one of the basement rooms of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]] [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]]. According to renowned wizards such as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] and Enel Cubus, he was an incredible mage who surpassed many in terms of knowledge and power. Winterbor had a particular interest in weather and weather manipulation; however, at some point, he was driven mad by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]].

In [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]], it was revealed by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] that the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] responsible for his madness were originally his closeted friends from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Sometime after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]] and the creation of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]], [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] was researching [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] and how to access it to acquire more crystals needed for the construction of the tower. While at the university, Winterbor was not considered as powerful as his two best friends, as their magic was much more destructive compared to his manipulation abilities. Consequently, they were sent on a mission instead of him. Unfortunately, the journey turned out to be a one-way trip, and his friends perished there.

### Notable Information 
During [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] met Winterbor to ask if he could manipulate the weather to create a storm to stop enemy ships from forming able to approach. He agreed, but not before two [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] appeared on his shoulder, telling Chenris, "You don't want to know".

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The headmaster revealed that making more towers was possible but would involve getting crystals. The only way to do this was to convert people into purely magical energy and send them to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to get crystals. However, the journey was one way as the people would often die or would slowly be turned mad. With sadness, the headmaster revealed that they lost a lot of very talented pupils doing this, which is why it is forbidden. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then went uncharacteristically serious and asked if, before this, there had been any known sightings of a beast known as the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. The headmaster said yes and explained that the primary theory was that anyone who died in [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] was turned into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. After a short pause, they asked if someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] studied at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Chenris speaks up and tells everyone present not to worry about this area of the battle field, gesturing broadly to the oceanic front behind [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], Stating he had a plan and needed to leave to make preparations. In the mean time, the rest of them should focus on getting more troupes for the war effort. With that, he turns on his heals, and leaves the war room, his destination? The [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]]. Once he reached his destination he approaches the clerk at the front desk and asks if there is anyone among their members that are proficient in large scare weather manipulation. The clerk mentions that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] is a strong mage with access to that magic but is not powerful enough to affect such a wide area as the elf described. They pause to think for a moment before tentatively suggesting to talk to a one [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] who can be found in the basement. Chenris thanks them for their time and goes to find this mysterious mage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | She's mad because they overslept on the big day of the war. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s forces are slowly approaching and would arrive very soon. She also questions them heavily on whatever the fuck they did yesterday since within the walls of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] there was a black dragon, fairies, Tree ents, goblins, trolls and airships. They apologise and say these are their forces to back up the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] in [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. She gives a big sigh and asks them to go their strategy for the war. Chenris explains that through research he conducted, he realised that there was a high probability that the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] would be pincered from land and from the back by sea since [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] have a massive and powerful fleet. He aims to use [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] to create a impassable storm to make the seas impassible to lock that side of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and force all [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s to attack on land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Clearly excited by Chenris' use for magic, Winterbor asks with all the charisma of a mad man if Chenris wanted to have tea. Chenris politely declines and tries to get to the heart of issue for his presence there. He starts to explain that the nation is at war with the Dawn and they need his help to stop their approach by sea. But before he can get any further, Winterbor asks him what a nation is and why is it fighting the sun in the morning. Realising that this man truly is mad but power, Chenris switches gears and says a friend called Terrance is desperate to have a tea party with him but isn't able to because some bad men are trying to stop him. Winterbor goes red with rage and ask how to stop the bad men and allow for this beloved tea party to happen. Chenris explains that they can be stopped if he causes a great big storm when is given a signal to and finish when he is given the all clear. The mad mage is filled with determination and agrees to help. Chenris thanks him for his time, but before he leaves he give [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] a quick examination to try and find the source of the man's madness. Explaining it as he was making sure winterbor is in good health for tea party since he wouldn't want to be sick and miss such a fun time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Halfway through his investigation the flow of time slows, fearing the influence of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], Chenris readies himself for combat but is instead confronted by, what can only be described as, two demons that appear on the mad mage's shoulders. Chenris questions if they are the reason for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]'s current condition and they conform his suspicions saying its really funny. Chenris ask why they would do this to such a bright mage. The demons laugh and state they did this because he was poking his nose in a place it shouldn't belong and we needed some entertainment. After getting over the initial shock of such otherworldly creatures, Chenris is able to determine these a creatures as what the academic community call [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]], hailing from The Realm of Magic. A place deeply entangled but distinct from one that all humanoids walk, and the source for all the world's magic. Not much is known about this realm or the creatures before the elf, but one thing if for certain, Chenris was in the presence of some very powerful creatures and one wrong move could spell his end. Putting up his best facade, Chenris laughs and acknowledged that is hilarious to watch such a great mage fall from such heights to the shivering mess of a man before him. The demons give great belly laughs before saying in a much more serious tone "You should also watch what you stick your nose into." before disappearing and allowing for the passage of time to continue as normal. Winterbor excitedly asks if he is ready for a grand tea party. Chenris, holding back his panic, affirms his readiness and tells him he will be picked up when the time is right and makes his exit with Winterbor returning to his antics. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | In the basement corridor, Chenris take a deep breath and starts to prepare some instructions for the guards on what they need to do with Winterbor. Leaving the basement, he returns to the clerk who seems surprised that he is even alive and congratulates him on his safe return. They exchange a quick comment about the mad mage before chenris moves on to ask if they know where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] is. As it turns out, Witherfeather had been in the foyer the whole time and Chenris just had seen him. Approaching the wizard, he apologises for his rudeness and asks for his help in closing off the seas. Terrance agrees to help and allegedly knew [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] before he had gone mad stating that in his prime, Agolin was one of the great wizards of current era. Chenris vows to find out why he went mad and return him to normal and ask if Terrance new anything. The wizard only knew that Winterbor was working on some secret project with The Dean of the mages guild before he went missing and Winterbor went mad. The wizard hasn't been in seen in nearly 5 years and that is the unfortunate end of Terrance's knowledge on the subject. Chenris thanks him for the information and his aid in the war and apologises as he must run to prepare for the rest of the war. They bid farewell as Chenris rejoins the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in the war room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
