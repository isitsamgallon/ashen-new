### Overview
Winterbor was the mad wizard that Chenris Tallfellow encountered during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the War for the OFC's Freedom]]. He was last seen in one of the basement rooms of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]] [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]]. According to renowned wizards such as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] and Enel Cubus, he was an incredible mage who surpassed many in terms of knowledge and power. Winterbor had a particular interest in weather and weather manipulation; however, at some point, he was driven mad by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]].

In [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]], it was revealed by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] that the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] responsible for his madness were originally his closeted friends from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Sometime after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]] and the creation of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]], [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] was researching [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] and how to access it to acquire more crystals needed for the construction of the tower. While at the university, Winterbor was not considered as powerful as his two best friends, as their magic was much more destructive compared to his manipulation abilities. Consequently, they were sent on a mission instead of him. Unfortunately, the journey turned out to be a one-way trip, and his friends perished there.
