This monumental shift in power marked the end of the [[History & Events/Eras/4th Era\|4th Era]] and ushered in the beginning of the [[History & Events/Eras/5th Era\|5th Era]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Chenris enquires about his opinions on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. The priest explains he was not a fan of the huge lose of life that the event caused. The priest elaborates, saying every God has their fanatics and extremists. Even the worshipers of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] have been known to use her name in vain and commit atrocities. Fortunately. There are moderates for every faith, including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. For example, the extremists believe that [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to come take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction. The moderates of the faction believe [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. The priest gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the humans, the Dwarves were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The humans, led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the OFC, there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the OFC is a pillar of freedom and equality. |
