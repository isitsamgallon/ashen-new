### Overview
Dhuggith Broadcloak was a dwarf king who rose to prominence during the [[History & Events/Eras/4th Era\|4th Era]] and the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]]’s decline. As internal strife weakened the empire, Dhuggith sought to secure his future by venturing into uncharted northern territories. There, he established [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]], where he used the steam geysers of the local hot springs to create a powerful mechanical army of automatons.

### Notable Information
- Dhuggith’s mechanical army became the cornerstone of his military campaign to conquer northern dwarf villages, consolidating his power through force. However, this conquest had unintended consequences, as the army’s advance freed many human slaves. These newly liberated individuals took up arms and overthrew towns and cities once controlled by dwarves, adding to the empire's instability.
- Dhuggith’s ambitions alarmed the southern lords, leading to the [[History & Events/Battle of Earthgrog\|Battle of Earthgrog]], one of the bloodiest conflicts of the [[History & Events/Eras/4th Era\|4th Era]]. Although Dhuggith's army was defeated, the southern forces suffered catastrophic losses. Despite this, Dhuggith declared himself emperor of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]], but his reign was short-lived. He died just two years after his declaration, marking the end of his conquests and the rise of a more peaceful era under new leadership.
