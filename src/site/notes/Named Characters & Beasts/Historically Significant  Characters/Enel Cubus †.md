### Overview
The Dean of the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]] is located in the [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. He has allegedly been out travelling for the past 5 years, but no one has heard from him in a long time. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] wants to find Cubus as he is potentially the only one who might know what causes [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] to go mad. In [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]], Chenris searches the dean's office and finds a [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Map to Itone\|Map to Itone]] and notes mentioning [[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]] giving them possible clues as to his whereabouts. 

### Notable Information
- It was later revealed in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] that Enel had been killed by [[Uti †\|Uti †]] when he entered the island.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Chenris says they should go to the Library and learn about the Dwarves in the library and then send ofd the quest to recover the cities riches. While they're at it, they should also exonerate Horrigan. Going to the library, Korrigan tries to find any information on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] but cant find anything. Chenris, having better luck finds a book detailing the history of the Dwarves called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy\|The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy]]. Before they leave Chenris wants to go to the deans office to try and learn anything abouit [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]]'s whereabouts. He finds a lot of notes on what he was researching but most of seems to be the scribbles of a madman, however one of the notes says "[[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]" there's another that mentions the locations [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]]. Finally, there are a few mentions of a place called "[[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]]" a place on another continent to the one where the campaign is set. Korrigan searches the desk and finds [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Map to Itone\|a faded map that shows how to get to Itone]] |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | Chenris decides to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] to ask questions about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]] and his disappearance. Ebis isn't able to help with a lot of details but points him in the right direction to find out more. After this, Chenris leans in and asks about him transforming in to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]]. Ebis denies knowing anything about this but after some pushing he gets up locks the door and transforms into the leader of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]], then quickly into Suicide bomber from the airship. He then switches back into to Ebis, unlocks the door and says "And no one will believe you". Chenris tries to calmly walk out and as soon as he is out of earshot of Ebis he runs like hell to his books to to figure out what he just saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
