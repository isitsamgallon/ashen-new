### Overview
The Dean of the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]] is located in the [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. He has allegedly been out travelling for the past 5 years, but no one has heard from him in a long time. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] wants to find Cubus as he is potentially the only one who might know what causes [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] to go mad. In [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]], Chenris searches the dean's office and finds a [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Map to Itone\|Map to Itone]] and notes mentioning [[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]] giving them possible clues as to his whereabouts. 

### Notable Information
- It was later revealed in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] that Enel had been killed by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] when he entered the island.
