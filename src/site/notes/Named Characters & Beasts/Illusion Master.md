### Overview
A mysterious figure [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] met in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]] who appears to be one of the most powerful mages they have ever met. He is capable of casting widespread illusion magic that is tailored to every person's wants and desires. He has mentioned that he has control over many different towns and cities across [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It is unknown what areas he has power over, however, after failing to make a deal with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] he banned everyone from ever entering his domains again. 

During their time in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]], Chenris met the man, or an illusion of him, where he was offered the aforementioned deal. The mage was offering to give the whole party protection from even the Gods and their perfect lives if they would stay inside the illusion. Chenris refused and then left. 

### Notable Information & Theories 
- It is theorised that the mage might be one of [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] or even a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of some God. His final remarks detailed how they would probably meet again, he just hoped it wouldn't be on opposite sides of the battlefield.

| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | With Chenris nowhere to be found, the party decide to go on the offensive and try to imagine as many things as they can that they've seen on their adventures. Korrigan especially thinks about all the strange things found in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. This course the illusion to glitch before Korrigan is put in a black void where he hears "Stop being so annoying, have some time out" Korrigan shouts back to give him chenris back, its not like he could hurt either way. At that moment, Korrigan sees a window showing Chenris talking to a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Mysterious Man]] sat at a large table with a feast with many people pointing bows at chenris, read to kill him at any point. |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]] tries to make a deal with chenris by saying that he can offer protection for the party, even from the Gods. Chenris raises his doubts about this and ensure him that tricking the mind can do wonders. Their end of the deal is that they have to stay in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]] - forever. Chenris refuses. The man tries to reason that is it not good to give the party everything they have ever wanted? He then goes on to list all of their latent desires one by one:                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
