### Overview
First met in [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 41\|Session 41]], Tish was one of the first slaves [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] met in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. He lived in a tent within the mines of the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|siltwater slums]], and compared to most others, he lived in relatively good [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions\|conditions]]. He notably had a very close bond with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]], the person he lives with. 

Tish was later killed by [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], in a deal she made with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] to put someone in his place when he was turned into a golden statue during [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s fight with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi Darkthorne †]].

### Description
#### Appearance
Tish is described as quite a plain-looking person. Like most of the slaves in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], he is constantly covered in dirt and grime and only wears rags. 

#### Personality
When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first met Tish, he seemed very kind but extremely apathetic. This is most likely due to the guards slowly grinding down his willpower. He was also there for the [[History & Events/First Lost Haven Slave Revolt\|First Lost Haven Slave Revolt]], where he watched everyone get crushed and mutilated for engaging in the revolt. 

As he gets to know [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], it seems like their evolutionary sentiment rubbed off on him. He is seen getting much more involved and even helping [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] enact their revolt by offering advice and useful information. 

Tish's kindness was evident from the start. As soon as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] awoke in the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|siltwater slums]], he was there to help by offering them advice and answering their barrage of questions. He is also exceptionally kind towards [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]], often prioritising her safety and comfort over his own. The best example of his kindness and selflessness was when the Church of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] gave [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] some extra rations. They offered to split some with him, but he initially refused. After they wouldn't take no for an answer, he gave [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] a large portion of his.

### Relationships
#### Misty
Tish and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] have an almost father-daughter bond, as he clearly cares for her very deeply. It is currently unknown how they came to be so close; they're not related by blood, but it has been implied that she was born into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]]. 

#### Kal
It is clear from the beginning, when he was unaware that [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] was Ka1 from the revolt, that he respected him for at least trying to stand up for what was right. However, he hated how difficult the first slave revolt made his life after [[Kal †\|Kal]]'s alleged death. He thought the name was more trouble than it was worth. 

### History
Not much was known about Tish before [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] met him during the Freedom's Flame Saga. However, it was revealed that he was still a slave six years ago, when the first revolution occurred. He was a member of a small faction that refused to get involved.

| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 48\|Session 48]]    | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] continued to explain that they had all lost a great man. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] innocently stated that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], by all accounts, was a great man, which got him a glare from [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mumbled something about wanting to learn guitar. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] offers to teach them the instrument, but before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] can respond, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] puts a caring hand on their shoulder and asks, "Would you like to talk about it? We could talk about your feelings. What is this doing to your senses? I admit I'm better at the physical part of doctoring, but I want to be better at this bit as well"                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | With laughter echoing on the wind, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] appeared next to a frozen statue of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] stuck in a state of fear forevermore. Unable to stop for a moment to see the man who had helped them so much, he rushed for Sara's body. His suspicions were correct; this was a regular tower. In fact, he could practically hear the [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] voice calling out to him. Remembering [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]]' notes from when he destroyed [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|the tower of Ishnmel]], he reached out to the power left in [[Other Information/The Towers\|the tower]]'s crystals and accepted it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] appeared running through the courtyards and collapsing to her knees, tears spluttering as she saw [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]]'s harrowing fate. She fell entirely to the floor as she cried over her father's death. "You were the best father I never had..." she thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | With the gates unguarded, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] led the way to [[Groups & Factions/Luminara\|Luminara]]. Before crossing the threshold, he looked over his shoulder to check on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], who seemed fine, having stayed on the sidelines during the fight. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], "All right, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], what's the plan? We head straight to the palace? I think we have magic..."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | After helping make the Molotov cocktails, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] drew a detailed map of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] pointed out choke points they could use. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to Aiden, pointing at the wall where the bow and armour were, and asked him to sneak down to grab them. Aiden nodded, sneaked off, and quickly returned, having not been spotted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] looks at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and asks if he has any opinions on this. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], looking tired but determined, simply states, "I think it's a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late for being passive. I think at this point we have to fight."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

They wondered if one should stay behind and help armoured people up. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] reassuringly puts a hand on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s shoulder before nominating himself to help the slaves organise.

Inside, he began fashioning [Molotov Cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail). [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] helped make them. While making them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that the wooden gate went to the huntsman's quarters. After the slave revolt, they were separated from the main slave population to help prevent another one. Once all the Molotov Cocktails had been made, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] attached long fuses to them and placed them all over [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], mainly in abandoned buildings and near the wall. He wanted to create a distraction to help the other escape. Once they had all been set, he lit the fuse and returned to the tent. |

Determined to get their food this time, they followed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] to the mess hall. Inside, they were given small, dirty bowls of gruel. Outside, the antimagic field was powerful, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] traced it somewhere on the central city's other side of the wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | Sitting down with their "Food," [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asked if anyone from the first rebellion was in the hall. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] had a quick look before pointing out one man who [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] instantly recognised as one of the people from the rebellion fighting force. His joy was overcome with dread as he realised that during the rebellion, this man had had his leg cut off by a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] as punishment; it was now replaced with a crude metal one. The man's face was also quite badly scarred, and half of one of his arms was also missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] took a deep breath before sitting down to start explaining what happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
