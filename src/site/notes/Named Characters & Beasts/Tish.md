| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | After helping make the Molotov cocktails, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] drew a detailed map of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] pointed out choke points they could use. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] turned to Aiden, pointing at the wall where the bow and armour were, and asked him to sneak down to grab them. Aiden nodded, sneaked off, and quickly returned, having not been spotted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] looks at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and asks if he has any opinions on this. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], looking tired but determined, simply states, "I think it's a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late for being passive. I think at this point we have to fight."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They carried on through [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]], noticing that the surprise had worn off and the guards were starting to fight back and kill slaves. They wondered if one should stay behind and help armoured people up. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] reassuringly puts a hand on [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s shoulder before nominating himself to help the slaves organise. "Aiden and i have got it from here"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | A few hunters stay behind, ready to help. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] catches up, exclaiming that it's very bloody in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] points to the doctor, saying that he will help where he can. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] sarcastically replies, "I think it's gonna take a bit more than a doctor to reattach a head!" but thanks him none the less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | "I think we need to take off the head of the snake." said [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] simply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | "Yes, let's do that," said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], do you know where we had some magical weapons taken from us. Do you know where they would be?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | During their meal, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] noticed that they were all coughing and was saddened that it seemed they had caught Lung Rot so quickly. He explained that it was an infection caused by scars from soot or coal dust in the lungs. They, especially [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], were slowly dying, and if they didn’t get treatment from a doctor, it would get worse and be a painful death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | Watching his friends safely go through the gate, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] returned to the house with all the alcohol in it, grabbed as many bottles as he could, and returned to their tent. Inside, he began fashioning [Molotov Cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail). [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] helped make them. While making them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that the wooden gate went to the huntsman's quarters. After the slave revolt, they were separated from the main slave population to help prevent another one. Once all the Molotov Cocktails had been made, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] attached long fuses to them and placed them all over [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], mainly in abandoned buildings and near the wall. He wanted to create a distraction to help the other escape. Once they had all been set, he lit the fuse and returned to the tent. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | He then asked if they had managed to get their food in time. That was when they realised none had remembered to grab food, but luckily, they had the radishes from the priest. The man tried to refuse [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] sharing the food with them, but they didn't care and broke off a share for him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] insisted he take some food for being so kind to them and for asking for his name. He introduced himself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] and the little girl as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | They all introduced themselves, with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] going last, saying his name was [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]]. Upon hearing the name, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] suggested that he change it while he was here. He explained that [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]] was the name of a person who gave the slaves a lot of hope, hope that had since been crushed. Interested in his legacy, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked for more information. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]] had nothing left. His family was gone, his friends were gone, everyone was gone. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] reiterated, "You don't want to be a [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]], friend."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | "No, he would know that we don't turn our own in. it's hard not to hear without infighting." [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained, "It'd be a miracle if he was alive, though.
