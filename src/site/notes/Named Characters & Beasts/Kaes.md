| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]] | As the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] hung back, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nervously stayed put. He wanted to ask who was currently running the fort after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death. The guards explained that after her heroic death, her son, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Kaes\|Kaes]], took over. Unlike his mother, he is a very intelligent ruler, much colder and calculating. The conversation eventually turned to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], where guards admitted they had heard how bad it had gotten, and its reputation had been run into the ground. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] chimed in, asking the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]]'s opinion on unions. The guards explained they didn't have one as they were all family at the fort, leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uneasy. |
