| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Chenris enquires about the author of the book [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] and the receptionist doesn't know much about him but says he must be important. Chenris thanks him for the time and enters the library. The library itself is a huge circler room with stain-glass icons of the gods above their special sections. Each section has a portal to that priest's room. |
