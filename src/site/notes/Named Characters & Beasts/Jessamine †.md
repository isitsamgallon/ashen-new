| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was nearly in tears at this point, said that they could go to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and open the shop there. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] insisted that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't have Cancer, which only convinced them that they had "Death Disease". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say something else, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stepped in, saying that he had a way to make [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] feel better. They said they would be more than happy to have a distraction, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] teleported both of them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] waited in the [[Locations/Feywild/Temple of Lorwyn\|Temple of Lorwyn]] while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] found themselves in front of the familiar wooden shake in [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]]. They tentatively approached and knocked on the door, and the beautiful [[Eladrin\|Eladrin]] they once knew was now very old, she instantly recognised them and invited them in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that they said they would return before asking what their name was they now realise they never got it when they were last here. She laughed before introducing herself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | They continued their work as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] returned inside. before they got out of earshot, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] explained that they would find a way to elevate their back pain so they would have an easier time. She thanked him before returning inside. Soon, hours turned into days, then days into weeks and over time, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] became much more enthusiastic about the chicken noodle soup again, as it was one of the few nutritious meals [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] could make in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | They spent a long time together as they spent their days peacefully working the farm and animals. One day, she asked them why they returned to her cabin after waiting for so long. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they weren't in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], and time seemed to floor differently here. for them, it has been a week at most. they also explained how they had caught a disease called the death disease, and they wanted to re-tune and say a proper goodbye. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] commented on how death did come for them all [^4].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | One day, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] woke up and couldn't find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] anywhere. She didn't return his calls, and after a while, they became quite worried for her. They finally checked her room and found it empty; however, strangely, her clothes were crumpled on the floor like they had been worn one moment and then suddenly fell off her as she had disappeared. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was incredibly saddened by this and went into autopilot as they began the daily chores. it wasn't until much later that they finally worked up the courage to return to the room and sort her things. Looking through her clothes on the floor, they found a note and began to cry as they read it; it was the chicken noodle soup recipe. Feeling strange about having such strong emotions on a note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | With nothing left in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], they left the hut and set the animals free. They walked through [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]] for 500 years before finding [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] again. For him, it had only been a few hours, and he was enjoying his own chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]s approached, their youth returning as they walked closer to their friend. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asked if they were ok, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] explained their experience with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] and 500 of walking. When hearing how long they had been walking, they exclaimed that this was good as the death disease hadn't killed them yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked a little better after hearing this before quoting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] saying that "death disease does for us all". looking very concerned, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asked if it was contagious before using the flora on the ground to push [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] back. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], for their part, tried to fight the movement by speed walking forward [^5]. They soon convinced [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] that it wasn't contagious and were allowed to rejoin him before they teleported back to the material plane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
