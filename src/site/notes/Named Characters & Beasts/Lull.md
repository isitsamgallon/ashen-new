| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | At that moment, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lull\|Lull]] walked in, and with a huge grin, he said, "We have to fight, no doubt about it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] woke up to their now familiar routine of a Goliath Guard barging into their tent and marching down to the depths of the mines to mine for 11 hours. The only difference this time was that much of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]) had contracted a violent cough; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan seemed fine. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s cough seems much worse than the others. Once they were free from the mines, they went down to the mess hall to get their food for the day before it was thrown away. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lull\|Lull]] gave them a knowing wink while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was deep in thought about how they could fix the magic situation, and concluded that they would need some kind of distraction or reason for leaving [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], like joining the hunters, but none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] knew of a straightforward way to join the hunters. |
