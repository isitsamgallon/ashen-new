| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | The old man gave a kind smile before opening his ledger and asking if they knew who their supervisors were. Once hearing this, they didn't know this information either, and he started listing names, putting considerable emphasis on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra Goldmark]], who, they presumed from his tone, was of a higher station than the rest.                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] only walked up and stated that they were here to pick up an order for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | "Are you sure you wanna piss off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] more than they already are?" bluffed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] can lick my boot, I answer to Rick no'ne else." he man barked "If we're gonna have a problem hear i sugest you bring the form or bring [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] herself, without those, you'll get nothing"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had spent most of their time analysing the women's eyes, and from what they could tell, it was a rare magical consideration that allowed the owner to see through anything to see someone's true intentions. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] had also been thinking and was certain that his person, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]], didn't have much combat power, but she was clearly incredibly charming.                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] smiled and nodded in agreement. She even offered to host [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] at her house since the snowstorm was so powerful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Astra Goldmark\|Astra]] began to give direction to the house not too far from the armoury before beckoning the other to join her. She took them to a large increaibly ornate building. Inside, which was filled with many plush sofas, cushions, and golden statues, she guided them to their own individual room and showed them where to find the facilities. "I hope you enjoy your stay at the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]]", she said coyly before leaving for her own room. |
