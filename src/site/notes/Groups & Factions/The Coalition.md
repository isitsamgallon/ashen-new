| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Without missing a beat, the headmaster asked if they were ready to take on the mantel of uniting the world against [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. They were all quiet before Mordecai meekly asked if anyone else could do it. The headmaster wasn't sure but knew that someone had to try at least. He asked what they could all bring to the table to help fight and band everyone together into another version of [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]]. Mordecai explained that they were good at talking to people and gaining their trust, which would help them. drache was good at fighting and could win people over with his strength, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and korrigan[^9] were Smart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | They enter her room and are greeted by a large room filled from head to toe with books. Chenris walks in and addresses her with royal decorum (She doesn't care), Drache gives a short bow and Korrigan just stands there and waves. She asks what they need to tell her. Chenris explains the threat of the bandit camp and their weapon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Grom\|Grom]] and she asks for them to show her on a map and puts a large map on the floor. Chenris uses [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) to point to the spot on the map. He then talks about [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] that had fallen the night before. She says that she remembers reading about the tower but doesn't seem too concerned by it falling. Chenris asks why and she remarks that if it was stopped before than it can be stopped again. Chenris responds by saying he's not so sure since it read to him that [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] won mostly out of luck. She doesn't agree but respects his opinion. |
