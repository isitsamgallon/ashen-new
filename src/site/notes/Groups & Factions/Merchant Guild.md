- Handle and relay information on the price of goods in different regions, allowing merchants to make more money from their speculative trading. The guild could even hire spell casters to use sending to send updates between regions really quickly. Protecting these ledgers and notes from rival traders outside of the guild would be important
- Officiate licensing of merchants. If you're not a member of the guild and you want to trade in these waters, then you don't get to use the guild's ports, shipyards or warehouses.
- Organise brokers and freighters. There will be folks for buying and selling as well as folks for moving goods between locations, and part of the guild's responsibility should be in making sure they play along nicely.
- Fund anti-piracy and anti-monster measures. Making sure that your merchant fleets are protected from pirates will be important but as this is a fantasy world you'll also have to deal with seafaring monsters. Hire some well equipped adventurers to sail out and deal with these problems.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Upon hearing this, Korrigan enters the tavern apologising for his drunk friend and ask if they're getting ready for a fight like potentially at the [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. They say their not in the grave robbing business and mostly do protection work. To keep the conversation going he offers to buy them a drink. He gets a drink but the bartender insinuates that it's free without saying anything out loud. The man explains that they have been protecting the village since [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s guards stop protecting the town and disappeared. They mostly are protecting people from bandits and thieves  and complains that The Dawn isn't as safe as it used to be. People apparently used to be able to travel without issue but now people are being murdered and robbed and their carriages are being raided. Korrigan shows them their carriage and asks if he recognises if who it belongs to. He doesn't know them personally but explains it's part of the [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]]'s fleet. Chenris, who stayed with the carriage asks where they could find one and is told they're in most major cities. Korrigan offers to help with watch but is turned down and as the man and his crew take great pride in in protecting the village. They get a room and go to sleep. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Outside, Mordecai attempts to get rid of the [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] decals to make their cart less suspicious. However, his attempt fails and he accidentally triggers an apparition that says not to tamper with guild property. After some investigation, Chenris figures out that the [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] like to posses their carts as alarm system and it is mostly harmless, if a little annoying. Mordecai attempts to cast [Dispel Magic]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) on it but fails. Chenris then figures out this is very old magic being used here so he casts [[Other Information/Display Tags/Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic\|Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic]] and it disappears straight away. Chenris uses his magical tinkering to put the party name on it and they name the horse [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Boogaloo\|Boogaloo]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] goes up with the airship and they party get on the dragon to travel to their command post, but before this the dragon takes them up to the skies and shows that the army has a massive canon. its the same canon from when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ran into the [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. they decide not to deal with it now in favour of keeping their surprise advantage. They land but send some fair dragons to try and disable the canon, which fails. the rest of the dragons are sent up with the airships to deal with those with confusion spells etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | Along the road as they're turning around, a [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] caravan full of important weaponry refuses to let us interact with them, Chenris noted that they had a lot of guards and seemed to be going in the direction of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
