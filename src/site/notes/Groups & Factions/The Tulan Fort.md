### Overview
A mercenary fort that used to be led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and is the rival to [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. It is located towards the southern end of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]]. There is a secret tunnel going through the mountain range that connects to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] that [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] used to meet his lover, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] secretly. It was noted that its main fighting force is treated incredibly poorly compared to its rival, with armour that is one size fits all and tents to sleep in rather than barracks. It notably sided with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. It was also part of [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]], however, this was under different leadership.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom Fighters/Session 41\|Session 41]]              | As the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] hung back, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nervously stayed put. He wanted to ask who was currently running the fort after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death. The guards explained that after her heroic death, her son, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Kaes\|Kaes]], took over. Unlike his mother, he is a very intelligent ruler, much colder and calculating. The conversation eventually turned to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], where guards admitted they had heard how bad it had gotten, and its reputation had been run into the ground. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] chimed in, asking the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]]'s opinion on unions. The guards explained they didn't have one as they were all family at the fort, leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uneasy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], still on the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] with her giant ice spider, hurried to escape from [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. They could hear shouts and screams from within the fort as they rushed to raid for the chaise. While [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] panicked and attempted to devise a plan to get out of this situation, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly took out their [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and began casting a spell to rewrite aspects of the world. The spell changed the problem so that the people in the fort were no longer angry with them and were willing to offer a choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly signalled for the group to continue their journey and attempted to steal the book when no one was watching, wanting to protect the elf's innocence. They all climbed into the carriage and travelled until they reached the gates of [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], where they could hear distant sounds of people training hard. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to open the door, only to find it locked, which everyone presumed was for the best. However, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was determined to see what was happening inside the fort and found a spot to peer through some cracks in the wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | For the last few days, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] has been travelling back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to retrieve the horse and cart. However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | After the infiltration of [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] took a few days to rest and heal their injuries. Unfortunately, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] 's injuries were much more serious than originally thought, and she wouldn't be able to travel for a while and needed bed rest. Hearing this, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] informs the party that he'll stay behind and make sure she is safe and will catch up with them when she can travel again. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], for his part, left at night, leaving a note explaining he had gone off to investigate something and would join the party later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | They discover that the name "Yakawa" refers to a temple at the top of the mountain, there is then a town surrounding it where people and pilgrims live or rest. The town is built on the mountain edge breaking the town into tiers going up the surface of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] with the shrine at the highest point. The town surrounding the shrine is protected by large palisade walls. It is currently late afternoon, so Drache suggests resting up now so they can sneak into [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] in the dead of night and have a better chance of rescuing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. They go to the Adventures Guild where two [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s are running the reception. Mordecai is unwilling to speak, not wanting to be accidentally noticed by anyone, so Drache is the one to ask for their usual two rooms. But once he is given the rooms, he insists they show him the way - something that is not typically at all, but they relent and awkwardly show them the way. Once shown to their room, Drache suggests having 'an emergency meeting' to discuss their plans. One of the receptionists comments "That's a weird name for a fivesome". Korrigan, forgetting that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was with them, says there are only 4 of them causing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to become mad at him again. She runs off stating that she'll get her own room. Korrigan tries to apologise but it's a lost cause. |

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | After a brief conversation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]], they can't decide weather to hire the goblins so they put it up to a vote with Chenris noting that they can use the goblin troupes as sacrificial pawns in the fight to make them easier to deal with later on. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] votes 4-1 with Kal being the odd one out to hire the goblins. They also decide that contacting [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] isn't worth it. [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] just isn't close enough to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to be able to make in time and the Fleet is just too unreliable. With that chenris motions for some guards to bring back the goblins and they agree to a deal. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had to physically force Korrigan to sign the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
