### Overview
**The Watchers**, also known as the **Guards of the Wall**, are a mysterious and ancient order tasked with the protection and maintenance of **the Wall**â€”a colossal fortification that separates **The Desert** from the **Verdant Peninsula**. Standing over 50 feet high and stretching beyond the horizon, the Wall was constructed shortly after the event known as **the Sundering** to prevent future invasions and delay any recurrence of cataclysmic disasters.

### Structure & Composition

The Wall is staffed by thousands of guards clad in pure silvery armour that shimmers in the light. Guards are stationed every 100 meters in pairs atop numerous watchtowers and around fortified gates. The soldiers represent a wide range of races, with over 30 species observed among their ranks. Despite their diversity, the Watchers operate as a unified and silent collective, exhibiting little emotion or individuality.

The guards' armour, which appears unusually pristine given its age, is linked to their continued presence. It was revealed that the armour itself binds the wearers to the Wall, keeping them stationed there indefinitely. These soldiers are believed to be the same individuals who originally manned the Wall upon its construction, with the armour assisting in preserving them far beyond normal lifespans.

### Governance

The Watchers are governed internally by a network of clerks and guards without a singular leader. Decisions are made collectively, and the organisation remains strictly neutral, refusing to involve itself in the political affairs of nearby nations. The Wall and its defenders operate independently of any external government or military force.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Watchers is to prevent the incursion of external threats into the Verdant Peninsula, particularly from the Desert. Their presence is also intended as a delaying tactic in the unlikely event of a second Sundering, potentially buying a decade's worth of time for surrounding civilizations.
