Sometimes [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] will use this to their advantage for disguises, like when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] disguised himself as part of the Taverns team that asked people for their opinions in [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]].

- [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] 
- [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] - The [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] know of it and see it as a low-class pub that none of them would want to go to.
