Allegedly he had stolen everything from the palace, even the furniture. The are no witnesses since most of the guards weren't on duty, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|keith]] had hired his own guards for some reason. with nothing else left to do they go to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to get some sleep. In the morning, they make their way to the palace to find that there is a lot more of a verity of races walking the streets of the city, a testament to the work Steve had been doing. |
