### Overview
The cult that Kidnapped [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]].

They worship [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] as the divine flame that must purge the world to make it pure. Its followers embrace destruction as sacred, believing fire cleanses all corruption and prepares the way for rebirth. They await his promised return, spreading his doctrine through scorched earth and fanatical sacrifice.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Looking at the airship in more detail, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] starts to remember weird visions of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|cults]] and needing to save people. Once hearing this, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] immediately comes up with a theory that maybe the crystal chatting from the magic of magic wave could have caused Chenris' and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's memories to somehow fuse together, explaining the weird pockets of knowledge they have. Throughout this whole process, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is notably hesitant to call Chenris by name, referring to them as 'you know' or 'the old man'. With little to garner from the wreckage, they decided to head back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]] since it was getting late. Before getting back into his carriage, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] took one last good luck at the scene, but more importantly, he was also looking for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] had some questions for the man, and he was angry he hadn't gotten them already. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | She asks where they got this book since it is quite heretical to own a piece of material that looks at [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] in such a good light and the two, slightly panicked explain that they found it in an [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] under [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] surrounded by flames of an exploded researcher. She notes that that is how most followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] tend to operate  (referencing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]) leading Mordecai to talk about the man that exploded outside the airship and asking about [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]]. Unfortunately, she has no idea what either of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | Chenris decides to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] to ask questions about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]] and his disappearance. Ebis isn't able to help with a lot of details but points him in the right direction to find out more. After this, Chenris leans in and asks about him transforming in to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]]. Ebis denies knowing anything about this but after some pushing he gets up locks the door and transforms into the leader of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]], then quickly into Suicide bomber from the airship. He then switches back into to Ebis, unlocks the door and says "And no one will believe you". Chenris tries to calmly walk out and as soon as he is out of earshot of Ebis he runs like hell to his books to to figure out what he just saw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
