### Overview
The Golden Ones are devoted scholars who pledge themselves to Aeloria in pursuit of limitless knowledge. In life, their sacred pact grants them access to truths both mortal and divine; in death, they serve eternally in the Golden Plane as her celestial researchers. Though revered, some whisper of minds lost in endless study, unravelled by the very truths they sought.

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] was an unwilling member of this group when he made a deal with the God for information on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] and did not stop to ask what he would have to give in return. 

The Golden Ones have the unique privilege of being able to ask Aeloria for any information they would like at a cost. However, this cost has a lower penalty than another person not a part of the group.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Chenris perks up and asks what a soul is. The orb tells him, that every creature has a soul which is a manifestation of that creature's very being. When someone dies their soul goes off to the afterlife, or the like, unless they are brought back to life with magic since it takes some time for the soul to travel off. The orb then says because you promised your soul to the goddess it's not there forever. If you die, there is no coming back. The orb theories that Aidan also can't be revived. chenris should be happy since he gets to research. Most gods don't make a pact like [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]. Most Gods allow souls to return with spells like [Revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify). He would assume Aidan would go to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] and Korrigan would eventually return to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Chenris asks if he gets special privileges for being a part of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]]. The orb scoffs and says he gets the privilege to access all of the world's knowledge, for a price of course. Mordecai has gone white with shock while chenris seems ok, he says it's a good thing that he has no intention of dying any time soon, the orb laughs and says he said the same thing when he was alive and now he is here. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Mordecai steps in and asks what he would have to give for the same information. The orb says because he isn't a part of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] the deal would be a lot harsher. This deal would lead to Mordecai forgetting everything about himself. Chenris starts circling through all his emotions as he silently contemplates his options. Mordecai tries to tell him that this isn't right and he shouldn't take the deal, although he is unaware if chenris can hear his pleas or not. The orb tries to bargain with more information like info on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and "how to make them treat you right". Chenris hears within the whirlwind of information in their head, that the first part of the passcode is the name of the person who the Auditors]] (Chenris forgets this after the conversation is over). The orb states that he just has to give this information over and he would be free. In chenris' head, he things back to all his memories of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]], the good and the bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | The orb is dismayed at this and says he won't get far in [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] with that kind of attitude. Chenris retorts by saying he has been doing just fine so far. It turns to Mordecai and says that hell sweeten the deal and make it so everyone who hates Mordecai; his father, his brother and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] would also forget about him. Mordecai would only remember his name and that he travelled with the party. He never understood who he was after this deal, he would be made anew. Mordecai asks Chenris if it is worth it, he states it depends on how comfortable he is with losing his identity. Mordecai would never understand who he is and the struggle he went through to get to this very place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
