The Golden Ones are devoted scholars who pledge themselves to Aeloria in pursuit of limitless knowledge. In life, their sacred pact grants them access to truths both mortal and divine; in death, they serve eternally in the Golden Plane as her celestial researchers. Though revered, some whisper of minds lost in endless study, unravelled by the very truths they sought.
