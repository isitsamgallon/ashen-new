### Overview
The Ashen Cult worships [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] as the divine flame that must purge the world to make it pure. Its followers embrace destruction as sacred, believing fire cleanses all corruption and prepares the way for rebirth. They await his promised return, spreading his doctrine through scorched earth and fanatical sacrifice.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked about The Tower, noting its distinct difference from the other towers before becoming slightly confused about what [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] were. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he was here before The Tower or Temple was built. Before the temple was around, there was nothing, just an empty plane. Then, a crystal crashed on this land, causing an enormous crater. Sometime after, A dragon appeared, and she explained she would use the crystal to ensure [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] wouldn't happen again. The people, still mourning the loss of their friends and family, desperately agreed. The dragon spent months and months building something that could use the crystal. Eventually, he was successful and went around the world using fragments of the crystal to build more towers all over. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] and the other priests soon gathered around to protect it, creating a church over it to hide it from [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] and anyone who might have bad intentions.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | Korrigan whispers to Drache and asks if they can quickly cast [Detect Good and Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good) and see what they learn. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] does just then and, to his horror, detects a considerable amount of undead energy emanating from Mordecai. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] hurriedly explains what he feels to Korrigan, who claims he'll cast his protection spell on Mordecai so they can ensure that Mordecai does not lose control over his body. The voice retorts that if they do that, they will make sure that when she leaves, she will make sure there will be nothing left of Mordecai's brain to function. Suddenly, it clicks with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] doesn't have any family, but they did recall that in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]], there was a female war general called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]. Willow confirms that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is correct and says that if they've read their bible, they know what can happen when too much of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' power is channelled through someone, and she can do that if anyone makes any wrong moves. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]] | Chenris then ask what would the followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] do in a theoretically perfect society, surely there would be no need to worship their beloved god since there is no evil to be wiped away. This question stumps the priest as he had never thought of that before, he doesn't have an answer. Chenris is about to leave when stops to ask one final question, "Do you know anything about one master Ebis?" the priest had heard the name but only as someone leading a magic guild somewhere. Mordecai asks if he knows anything about the grand plan. The priest hesitates before explaining, that the grand plan is often about how [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] wants to start [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Second Sundering]]. At this point the priest wants to confess that he was a general in the original army and led a legion of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]], however, he feels immense guilt for his actions and is trying to reform, his name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]]. They thank him for his time and leave.                                                                                                                                                               |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | In Elvish Chenris and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhear the city guards taking a newspaper article about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|The Emperor]] having gone missing since [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|his war with the OFC]] and that local lords have started taking more land/ control than they normally would leading to a lot of panic. Reportedly [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] is fine and hasn't suffered any loss or control. Mordecai, not understanding any of this, asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] and mentions that Chenris has been trying to translate an [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|old book]] and get the full story but has been struggling with the last few chapters. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] asks to see it and instantly reads the title of the book out in Ancient Dwarfish and then again in Common. Mordecai asks if she can translate it and she does just that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
