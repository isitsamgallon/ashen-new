The Black Cult serves [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] by embracing chaos, entropy, and the unravelling of time itself. While many are zealots who open rifts and spread disorder, others are desperate souls begging for more time, willing to risk everything. United by longing and madness, they believe only through collapse can true freedom be born.
