### Overview
The Black Cult serves [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] by embracing chaos, entropy, and the unravelling of time itself. While many are zealots who open rifts and spread disorder, others are desperate souls begging for more time, willing to risk everything. United by longing and madness, they believe only through collapse can true freedom be born.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | Seeking to lighten the mood, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shifts the conversation towards Aidan’s childhood. Aidan stiffens and reveals, “yeahhhh, I don't have parents.” Unaware of Aidan’s discomfort, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] inquires further into the circumstances of Aidan’s upbringing. Aidan explains that they were viewed as an experiment by their parents, who were members of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]], cultivating a sense of anger concerning their past, especially as their life has now become intertwined with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Korrigan quickly gets distracted when he realises Drache hasn't seen his new [Wild Shape](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) ability and quickly transforms into a large horse. Drache is impressed and tries to pick it up but the horse is way too heavy for him. Mordecai gets them back on track, as they think everything, including this weird spell at Dawnhaven, is the work of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]] and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. At this, Korrigan says "Chronohorsey" only drache can understand as he is able to understand animals. Transforming back into a Humanoid, korrigan tries his best to remember all of these old Thieves' paths into and out of the city. One of them is fairly close, and chenris surmises that the cult would almost definitely not attack them since the spell they are performing is so complex, it needs their whole focus to maintain it. As they're discussing their options, The ground begins to shake violently as a massive earthquake happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Korrigan then introduces Aidan as someone who has had the misfortune to talk to the deity directly and priest becomes somewhat interested in the two of them. Finally working up the courage to speak, Aidan asks if known the priest knows who they are - he doesn't. They go on to explain they deal but they aren't able to give many details due to Aidan's mind being wiped about the deal. They also mention that they were approached a second time to but he rejected it. All Aidan knows is that after the deal he started being able to use some magic that he was not able to before. Enquiring further he asks them if he has noticed any strange time phenomenon happening around them since the first deal was made. Aidan explains that he has had some small scale time powers for a while. These powers date back to his childhood when he was tortured in the same [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|cult his parents were in]]. without missing a beat, the priest notes that everyone has some degree of access to magic, but is incredibly rare to find someone with access to [Chronomancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronomancy#:~:text=The%20term%20%22chronomancy%22%2C%20stemming,involving%20supernatural%20manipulation%20of%20time.) |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | Much to Chenris' dismay, the party head back to Steelwick to save [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. As they are traveling through the rolling hills of The Dawn, Aidan spots a mysterious black figure off in the distance. Drawn in he recognises the creature's uncanny lack of face and the familiar pain of looking at [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] too long. Aidan, who had been becoming more and more unstable with matters related to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and his [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|black cult]] immediately yelled in fear and looked away and suffered the penalty to his memory and forgot. His quip of fear immediately alerted the rest of the part to something being wrong questioned the rouge on what scared him so. Upon hearing that he doesn't remember, that group struggle to arrive to a conclusion since they were sure [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] had been vanquished long ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
