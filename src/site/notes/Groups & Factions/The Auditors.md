### Overview
The Auditors, founded by Akin Netch, are an ancient and secretive order dedicated to one sacred mission: to maintain the balance between all forces of the realm—natural and supernatural. Unlike other champions of the age, the Auditors were not bound by morality or personal allegiance. They were answerable to the realm itself, an unshakable force guided by Akin’s wisdom.

Akin saw to it that the Auditors were trained in not only martial skill but also in the subtle arts of diplomacy, espionage, and the manipulation of magic. They were sent into the world with one mandate—to audit and adjust the balance where it was necessary. Whether stopping tyrannical rulers, quelling powerful magical entities, or even tempering the ambitions of would-be heroes, the Auditors operated in the shadows, agents of equilibrium.

Each member of the Auditors has a piece of Akin, binding them to the same mission, a silent brotherhood sworn to uphold balance in all things. Their work would continue for centuries, their actions shaping the realm in ways unseen by common folk.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that the only other way was through [[The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s corpse becomes quiet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | With everyone eating some food the man leaned back and told them to sign the contract. He is completely unwilling to tell them anything about his identity or what he is doing, stating that he is under no obligation to do so. "I have been more than patient with you a lot. sign it or die a 1000 gold poorer." the man said. Chenris agrees to sign it, much to the shock of the party. "You don't want to die do you?" he says as the man conjures a purple portal above chenris and drops the contract onto this lap. Not wanting to move, he signs the contract with [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) and encourages the rest to do the same. The masked man seeing their hesitation, bargains that he will allow one question to be asked of him and he will answer to the best of his abilities as he is on a tight schedule. They brainstorm possible answers as they try to figure out the best way to learn as much as possible with one question. Some of these ideas are "What is your name?", "What are your intentions, good or bad?" or "Are you a part of [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?". With that last one is an ongoing theory of theirs ever since they say the purple mist, flames and portals since they're very reminiscent of Xekai's magic. While they are discussing, the man amends the contract to include their one free question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | With a more sombre tone, they now head for Dawnhaven. As the city came into view, they were met with an alarming sight: surrounding the city were loads of people in heavy black robes with black tendrils shooting out from their outstretched arms into the centre of the city. Surrounding them was a thick purple mist, Chenris sensed dark energies being used but was unable to understand their purpose. The magics felt familiar, but none could place where they had felt it from before. A few moments of silence passed as they also looked stunned at the scene. The silence was broken by Korrigan, who said, "Wait, doesn't that purple remind you of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]]          | Chenris had exited the portal last and had spent the time observing the mysterious mage. His simple black clock gave little away but his portals were very strange. They weren't natural, so to speak. Chenris' understanding was that they weren't the result of a spell but something else entirely, possibly unique to the man. Chenris stepped forward and asked, "Are you unable to answer because [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] won't let you?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | Chenris says they should go to the Library and learn about the Dwarves in the library and then send ofd the quest to recover the cities riches. While they're at it, they should also exonerate Horrigan. Going to the library, Korrigan tries to find any information on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] but cant find anything. Chenris, having better luck finds a book detailing the history of the Dwarves called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy\|The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy]]. Before they leave Chenris wants to go to the deans office to try and learn anything abouit [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]]'s whereabouts. He finds a lot of notes on what he was researching but most of seems to be the scribbles of a madman, however one of the notes says "[[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]" there's another that mentions the locations [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]]. Finally, there are a few mentions of a place called "[[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]]" a place on another continent to the one where the campaign is set. Korrigan searches the desk and finds [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Map to Itone\|a faded map that shows how to get to Itone]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Korrigan makes a net of vines as a cushion in case he fell off the tower when he climbs up it later. The fall would defiantly kill him, but having some on on the inside of the tower would be super useful and he could tell Steve what was happening. Mordecai uses [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self) to make him look like a guard and sneaks in to the tower with Aidan. They tell the guard that they’re changing shifts and the guard is too exhausted to question it and leaves. Aidan breaks the lock and Mordecai reveals that they’ve come to save him. As they're trying to figure out how to escape with Steve, when a massive [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/The Black Dragon\|black dragon]] arrives at the window at 3am and they all climb aboard, it was sent by [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], but the dragon didn't know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

- When writing up the notes for them, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] didn't have a name for the group since [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] hadn't revealed it yet. Same decided to make something up and made it super weeby. Leading to the temporary name of "The Emmence's Shadow Garden"
