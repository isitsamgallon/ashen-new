| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 56\|Session 56]] | Finally, the man said he would write them in for now, but they really needed to learn the names of at least the important people in the fort. He then asked for their ID cards so he could register them properly. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they had lost their way after being attacked by a [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] in the forest. The man let out a sigh before commenting that this happened all too frequently and that he would talk to leadership about getting rid of the physical ID system once and for all.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cleared a space on the first floor inside their [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]] and tried to get comfortable. Their spell had made the area much warmer than the frigid, never-ending winter outside. From within, they watched as [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] called over the exhausted [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked him to help gather the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombies]]' corpses and bring them into the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], for further study. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] began helping and even called [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] over to help them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was extremely hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to help.                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | After a lot of back-and-forth, they had collected a [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]]. They began the arduous task of pulling the body towards the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took pity on the two. They quickly wrapped their coat tightly around themselves [^1] before poking out of the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]]. They summoned a Tenser's Floating Disk, which they could both more easily drag the corpses around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | It shuffled closer, its hand slowly raised to point at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], its head cocked to one side almost mechanically as it tried to understand the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|dragonborn]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], from within the Tiny [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Hut]], quickly noticed that the hunter was back on its feet. He rushed over to get a closer look; he was barely holding back his excitement as he inspected the body. With its frostbitten finger still pointing at [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] grunted, "He-at"                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] shook his head, and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]]'s head moved to face [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]]. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], for his part, was muttering about how this one had been killed with [[Other Information/Unique Items/Hunter's Arrows\|Hunter's arrows]] and should probably be dead. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nodded, saying it's almost like it's defrosting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | Upon hearing this, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] asked [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] for a lit torch to see what would happen. As soon as the fire began to burn, he watched the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] instantly start following it, first with its eyes, then as it lumbered towards it. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] held out the torch, and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] rushed over to grab it from his hand, then began rapidly warming its body. As it did, the cuts and wounds all started to heal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | The group watch the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] slowly heal some of its wounds before taking the torch back. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] almost looked annoyed that someone had taken away its source of heat. pointing to itself and grunting "Co-ld" with a cheeky grin, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] waved, saying "Nice to meet you Co-ld, i'm [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who was suddenly watching from within, got a flash of memories from [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], and they began putting a few things together. These [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombies]] were not only under a similar curse as the evelen canibels, but the curse was placed upon them by the same powerful mage. This magic was so powerful that one would need a lot more magic than anyone could gather in their lifetime. Interestingly, the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] actually died during the fight, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] didn't study Magical Fauna enough to know why. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] passed on some o thier observation to [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]], who began to wonder about the creature's nature. |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | He turned to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and asked if they would be ok with joining the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] in an experiment. After some convincing, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] eventually agreed, and [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] began casting Banishment as soon as the spell was finished. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] suddenly blinked out of the material plane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] thought they had their eyes open. It was strange; it was like the only thing that existed was the [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]]. They weren't surrounded by darkness, because that would still be something. They were surrounded by nothingness, but saying as much made the nothing into something which did not exist where they were right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | With the source of heat from the torch, the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] enveloped [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] in a bearhug. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] smelled terrible as it would not let go. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] struggled for a while before eventually giving in. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] had explained that the spell would last 1 minute before they returned. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] waited... and waited... and waited. The thought that time might not exist where they were, but they pushed that away before they could start to panic. After either a minute or a millennium, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] blinked, and they were back in the freezing cold of [[Locations/Snowport\|snowport]].             |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 55\|Session 55]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could not believe what was happening as their mind tried to process their experience in the void. They tried to make a witty remark, but all that came out was a single scream as their mind slowly unravelled. The [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombie]] let go of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], also confused about what was happening. it stumbbled back and right into the sword of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|Ringo]], who had snuck past everyone to land the killing blow. "Someone had to end it, and i'd didn't think it would be you lot"                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]] | They cheered their drinks to confirm the deal before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] mentioned that, before heading off, it would be good for them to get some sleep and rest up after their fight with the [[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|zombies]] in the forests. At hearing this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] 's ears pricked up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]] | "[[Groups & Factions/the Deathless Clan\|Zombies]]? decribe 'em for me." he barked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
