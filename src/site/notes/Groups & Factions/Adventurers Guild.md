| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | They stopped to rest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]]; everyone flashed their [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] tattoos at the front desk to gain entry until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed he didn't have any such tattoo. The receptionist flatly tells them that the fee is 50 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]] - Money [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] did not have. Aidan and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] offered to pay the fee, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] thanked them deeply and offered up the three pieces of [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] he owned for the payment. With the fee paid, they all get a good night's sleep. The next morning, while eating breakfast, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] gathers everyone but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] for a huddle ([[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] doesn't notice at all), and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] states that there are a lot of parallels between chenris and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and they should test him by making him do the directions. They call [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and ask if they could navigate them to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]]. When he asked, he suddenly remembered that he was mapping when the purple light hit and caused the ship to crash. He explained his hesitation but eventually said they'd, do it. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] navigates the next leg of their journey perfectly causing most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] a lot of confusion.                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] suggests finding an Inn or [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to rest and discuss the rest of their plan. Mordecai then remembers [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|where he is]], and with a nervous look starts to disguise himself so he isn't recognised by the locals. As they are entering the town, they walk past Drache's dirt drawing, it's not very good but Mordecai tries to encourage him by making up artist nonsense. Drache says "I'm glad you can understand it because I definitely can't!" As he starts to laugh heartily. Now with some more time on their hands, Chenris examines Korrigan's wound and explains that the disease is definitely curable and is fine for now, but if left unchecked then he could turn into a zombie. Korrigan admits he has a weird craving for brains, turning to Drache, as his stomach starts to growl. Drache exclaims there isn't much up in his head, but Chenris on the other hand would be a lot tastier. Chenris fearfully grips his head, stating "My cranium will stay firmly uneaten, thank you very much". Mordecai and Drache fashioned a muzzle from some rope and put it on Korrigan as a precaution.                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Before going to bed Chenris decide to go to the library and to learn anything he can about what was said. He couldn't find anything about Uti or the man who sacrificed himself and mostly just stuff he already knew about the Gods and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. He did find [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Eldritch Curse of Eldermire Forest\|The Eldritch Curse of Eldermire Forest]] a popular fairy tale in the town. Afterwards, he returns to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to get some rest Mordecai is waiting for them as they get back and asks if they find anything interesting they both lament the unfruitful search and decide to get some rest while they can. Chenris goes straight to bed while Mordecai stays awake to watch Aidan make sure nothing bad happens. He sheepishly congratulates Aidan for not taking the deal and eventually goes to bed himself. Nothing happens during the night and they wake up and prepare to leave. Korrigan says a quick goodbye to the people in the tower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | once they enter the city, they decide to go to [[Groups & Factions/Ye Old Tavern Down the Road\|Ye Old Tavern Down the Road]] to get some more information on what to expect with the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] situation. Allegedly he had stolen everything from the palace, even the furniture. The are no witnesses since most of the guards weren't on duty, keith had hired his own guards for some reason. with nothing else left to do they go to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to get some sleep. In the morning, they make their way to the palace to find that there is a lot more of a verity of races walking the streets of the city, a testament to the work Steve had been doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | As they leave for [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] they stop at the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to commission a quest to start the process of returning their riches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]]          | After the events of [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 15\|Session 15]] [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] go back to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to have a nights rest. and wake up the next morning for breakfast. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] decides he and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] should busk for a Deluxe breakfast (Worth 25 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]]) as a way to show up [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]. The staff agree that if they busk for an hour or so they'll get a breakfast on the house. Chenris overhears this and decides to show them up no matter what. Mordecai and Korrigan get their free breakfasts, Chenris orders the deluxe breakfast and bottle of their most expensive wine, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] orders a standard breakfast. Mordecai is mad at Chenris for ruining his prank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 15\|Session 15]] | The Dawn really don't trust Non-Human races. Mordecai uses disguise self on Himself and minor illusion to hid chenris' eyes. they go to the local [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to and pick up a quest to delivery a donkey to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. They next go to the local [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] to sell all of their luxury goods. The group sends a good amount of time haggling to get the best price - Drache backs down very fast, Chenris does slightly better but also doesn't fare to well. The clerk likes Kal's ring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Boris Johnson\|Boris Johnson]] at the guild says that most people are watching the trial for the murder of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord Ulan †]] by his son, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. The party decide to sleep on it and decide what to do in the morning. Aidan decided to go find his missing horse and stayed the night in a tree nearby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | Apart from their fateful encounter, they make good time and they get there just as night is falling and the party stay the night at an [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]]. Soon after their arrival, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] sheepishly asked Mordecai if they wanted to talk to them about what happened in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]]. The rest of the party hide at the top of the stairs and ears dropped the conversation [Scooby Doo Style](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscoobydoomistakes.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F167541852875%2Fok-so-the-gang-is-investigating-a-mysterious&psig=AOvVaw1f50zPDYnXzion6KP0Sflp&ust=1715696520642000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCMDrlN_pioYDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). Aidan explained that he doesn’t know how to function outside of being a weapon to be pointed at others and explained how he was sorry since being locked up in that sell took him back to his childhood which is a very traumatic time for him. Mordecai ends up telling him that he needs to get his shit together and stop trying to push away from the group as they are there to help them and they hug it out. Korrigan misty step into a the room to give him a hug as drache and chenris run off. Aidan cry’s himself to sleep. |

| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | The journey to [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]], offered the group a chance to reflect on their escape and bond amid the tense atmosphere. The quiet forest trail, marked by dappled sunlight and the faint scent of the sea, provided a deceptive calm. As Bridges shared the region's history, the group learned of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]] and its unique credit-based economy, posing a challenge to their reliance on [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]]. Entering the weathered port town, the adventurers found its resilience remarkable despite its scorched buildings and wary inhabitants. At the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]], they secured membership and lodging while navigating strict regulations, including a law against unlicensed magic. Chenris complied, purchasing a licence, but Mordecai defiantly refused, setting the stage for future complications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
