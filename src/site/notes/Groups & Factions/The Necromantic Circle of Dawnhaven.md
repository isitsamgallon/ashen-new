### Overview
Led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] as their Arch-Necromancer, this was a group of Necromancers responsible for the disappearance of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the death of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]. Their base of operation was in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]. Apart from their leader, many of the Circle's members seemed to be decently skilled necromancers and mages as they were able to concentrate on an incredibly complicated spell for possibly days or weeks. The members [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered within the Crypts, however, seemed to have been experimented on due to their volatile natures and lack of control over their own bodies while infected with purple magic.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | The man sighs before saying "My name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]], I'm a part of [[Groups & Factions/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]] and I'm trying to save the people of this city. Errr I take my whisky on the rocks. My clock has had a weird stain on it for years and I never bothered to wash it off. I'm here in the palace to make sure Galen doesn't do anything stupid." |
