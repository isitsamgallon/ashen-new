### Overview
Ivory Crest is facade for a thriving thieves' guild that operated covertly within the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. 

6 years ago, during a secretive initiation ceremony, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], signed the contract binding him to the guild's code and secrets. He had no choice but to continue down this unexpected path. As a member of the guild, Kal was trained in the art of thievery, lock-picking, and manipulation. Kal freed himself with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], Kal faked his death somehow(unknown)

The guild is also known for secretly stealing from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. They have people on the inside and there is secret access to the palace to funnel money out of the vault. 

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] was forced into being a member in the [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] [ In response to this, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] attempted to break into the guild to steal one of the magical slips of paper.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]]               | "The King was behind me. We confronted again. He stabbed me multiple times before throwing my body into the ocean. I drifted for hours or days before I awoke on some rocks. Now I know I awoke at the rocks below the [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]]. I was hauled out of the water and saved by..." his voice trailed off again, for he said, "Fey creatures saved me. And then I ran, got on land, and started heading as far away from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as possible. I got to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and heard about a great guild called the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]], and the rest, you know, is history."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | The man explains that he was originally planning to kill them but it is fortuitous that they have appeared as he needs someone to run an errand for him. Mordecai's eyes narrow in distrust while korrigan casts [Protection From Good And Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good) on Drache just in case something happens to them all. The masked man continues, stating that if they don't help him then they will be killed instantly. Looking at him carefully, Chenris understands that this man is at least 2 to 3 times stronger than Xekai and warns the party that he is not bluffing when he says that. The man wants them to sign a contract and then he'll leave them alone. pulling it out, the contract reads "You will do one task the contractor asks of you" Everyone is completely against the idea. To sweeten the deal he even offers 1000 gold each on completion of the task but refuses to elaborate what the task is until they have signed the contract. Drache seems ok after hearing about the gold, stating it could be used to help the OFC but is soon reminded of the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]'s contract and how easy it was for him to be manipulated. |
