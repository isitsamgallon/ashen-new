| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | This time, he found himself in a house he was all too familiar with. The smell of pancakes enveloped him as he followed it to the kitchen of his family home in [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. There, he discovered his parents cooking and his sister, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Freya\|Freya]], sitting at the table, waiting for breakfast. After they finished eating, his parents were much nicer than the ones he knew. His father then asked if he could go to the shop and pick up a few things. He nodded meekly before rushing off to the nearby [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. Inside, he found the items his father wanted, and while paying, he noticed a newspaper detailing the story of a group called [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Fatebreakers]]. They had died in an attack by the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]], which had caused a large forest fire. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 15\|Session 15]] | The Dawn really don't trust Non-Human races. Mordecai uses disguise self on Himself and [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|minor illusion]] to hid chenris' eyes. they go to the local [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to and pick up a quest to delivery a donkey to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. They next go to the local [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] to sell all of their luxury goods. The group sends a good amount of time haggling to get the best price - Drache backs down very fast, Chenris does slightly better but also doesn't fare to well. The clerk likes Kal's ring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | The group then decided its about time to turn in their quest for delivering the donkey. Korrigan is terrified when he finds out that the clerk at [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] wanted to eat the Donkey. Kerrigan thinks all animal lives a sacred. Eventually they get the donkey to safety with a farmer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
