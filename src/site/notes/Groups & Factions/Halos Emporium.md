| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | This time, he found himself in a house he was all too familiar with. The smell of pancakes enveloped him as he followed it to the kitchen of his family home in [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. There, he discovered his parents cooking and his sister, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Freya\|Freya]], sitting at the table, waiting for breakfast. After they finished eating, his parents were much nicer than the ones he knew. His father then asked if he could go to the shop and pick up a few things. He nodded meekly before rushing off to the nearby [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. Inside, he found the items his father wanted, and while paying, he noticed a newspaper detailing the story of a group called [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Fatebreakers]]. They had died in an attack by the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]], which had caused a large forest fire. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 14\|Session 14]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are in [[Locations/Ehobel/Nas Anor\|Nas Anor]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] says it might be an interesting idea for [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] to try selling his dagger and then returning it when they get away safely. Aidan is up for the idea, so they go to a [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] and sell the dagger for 50g. Afterwards, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] sells some Wyvern poison for 55g. With that done, the party head out for [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | The group then decided its about time to turn in their quest for delivering the donkey. Korrigan is terrified when he finds out that the clerk at [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]] wanted to eat the Donkey. Kerrigan thinks all animal lives a sacred. Eventually they get the donkey to safety with a farmer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
