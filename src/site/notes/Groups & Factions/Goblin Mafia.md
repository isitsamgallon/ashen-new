### Overview
A well-connected group of goblins that seem to have connections in nearly every nation. They were first encountered in Two Pines when they offered a quest to deliver a "package" to Blackwall, which turned out to be a bomb used to try and blow up [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|The Black Tower]]. They turned up various points in the story and a group involved in terrorism, blackmail, thievery, exploitation and presumably much more. 

They could be related to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Goblin Resistance\|The Goblin Resistance]] from back during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] but it is unclear if the Goblin Chief is even alive
