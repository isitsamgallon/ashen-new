### Overview
A well-connected group of goblins that seem to have connections in nearly every nation. They were first encountered in Two Pines when they offered a quest to deliver a "package" to Blackwall, which turned out to be a bomb used to try and blow up [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|The Black Tower]]. They turned up various points in the story and a group involved in terrorism, blackmail, thievery, exploitation and presumably much more. 

They could be related to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Goblin Resistance\|The Goblin Resistance]] from back during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] but it is unclear if the Goblin Chief is even alive

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | This time, he found himself in a house he was all too familiar with. The smell of pancakes enveloped him as he followed it to the kitchen of his family home in [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. There, he discovered his parents cooking and his sister, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Freya\|Freya]], sitting at the table, waiting for breakfast. After they finished eating, his parents were much nicer than the ones he knew. His father then asked if he could go to the shop and pick up a few things. He nodded meekly before rushing off to the nearby [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. Inside, he found the items his father wanted, and while paying, he noticed a newspaper detailing the story of a group called [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Fatebreakers]]. They had died in an attack by the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]], which had caused a large forest fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] soon arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Foxtail Orchards\|Foxtail Orchards]], they're very tense as they remember the contract they signed with the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] during the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|war]] meant that this town was their official territory. Korrigan manages to get a small look inside and everything seems calm. There aren't that many people on the streets, notably less than when they were last there. They decide to go in and have a look, there are no guards so getting to the tavern is pretty easy. Looking inside they see the Halfling barkeep still behind the bar doing their normal work and no one else around them. Chenris and Korrigan enter, and the barkeep welcomes them in. Mordecai asks how things are going. She notes that not many people walk through Foxtail anymore with the Pyramid]] blocking a lot of the trade and the goblins being murdered. According to her, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] came into town during the war and killed most of the goblins on their way to fight. The party promises to help the best they can and move on. |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Korrigan is slightly annoyed at the party as it feels like he was forced to yet another contract against his will referring to the one about using the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. The party reasoned that none of them really had a choice in the matter as they didn't particularly want to die. Aidan asks if korrigan knows anything about the crypts. Korrigan thought for a moment before saying he had heard of them, but they were just an old legend since nobody had really visited them, especially since they were originally built by the dwarven empire. This excited Chenris as they were walking through such a historical area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] soon arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Foxtail Orchards\|Foxtail Orchards]], they're very tense as they remember the contract they signed with the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] during the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|war]] meant that this town was their official territory.

| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]]          | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] were leaving [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] a member of the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] tries to assassinate Mordecai. The attempt actually succeeded, however, [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] intervened and gave [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] a choice of allowing this future to happen or to take a deal with him, Aidan took the deal making the attempt fail. Drache and Korrigan start chasing after the goblin. Korrigan had casted [Longstrider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2171-longstrider) on Drache so he is able to catch up very quickly with the goblin. It take a Cyanid pill before the group could get much information out of it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] regroups with drache and Korrigan, chenris finding out that the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] have put out a hit on [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] because the goblins blame the group for their invasion of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] not going very well. They leave for [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] as soon as possible and make the illegal crossing route legal so its ok. There's now a small cult that's popped up in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] lead by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]. He has capitalised on the hatred of the other races and used that to gather people to follow him. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] infiltrate his church where they find out he has been kind with people and offered them food while preaching about hatred, which is how he has gathered so many followers. This makes [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] very concerned and they send a messenger to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] to investigate into the cult in their absence. They find the person who crosses the water and get in the boat and head for [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | Chenris are currently own on the streets of Steelwick distracting the guards as they see this massive black dragon fly to the castle. The guards all now approach the castle to investigate the dragon as it come down to pick up the two of them. Mordecai [Messages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) Chenris not to panic as they’re about to be grabbed by a dragon. Riding on the dragon, the party get flown all the way to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] where they find Xekai and the city of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] battle ready with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] coordinating everything. when the party arrive, [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] are trying to strike a deal with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] for troupes in return for access to steelwick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
