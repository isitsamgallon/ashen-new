| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]     | [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained to the group that they used to work together on the other side of the mountain, close to the board of the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. She must've travelled down to this forest afterwards, which would explain why they hadn't run into each other since they had been down to this region before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] elaborated by saying she moved here when the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]] cut down their tree house, which outrages [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who had wanted to go to one ever since they were little and even offered to help Sylvia get revenge. Before they knew it, they had all decided to go and get revenge, with Sylvia taking it one step further and announcing that they should kill all the fruit Cutter for all the crimes they committed. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] was less enthusiastic about this; however, it was easily convinced.                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | They explained that they were holding a funeral for their friend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]], who had recently been killed by an [[Orcs\|orc]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been everywhere in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], "from [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the [[Locations/The Desert/Broken Ember Throne\|Broken Ember Throne]]," impressing everyone. they then revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been involved in many of the world's recent events, including [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], and even joined the hunt for a missing [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]][^6].  Seeing that it was getting a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] excused themselves, not before promising to get revenge for them if they ever ran into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]] on their travels. Before leaving, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] performed a funeral rite for them and sent the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]]'s soul to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s as he felt that this would be the best place for a person who loves adventure. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | Mordecai asks for a description of this 'Mordecai' under the guise that if they ever see the person, then they can report them to the guards. The guard describes Mordecai exactly but warns them not to engage since they're a very dangerous [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] known to murder people. If Mordecai is potted, then they should be reported to the nearest city guards. They ask for more details, but the guard is unwilling to give many details about their client or situation since it is a private matter, and the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]] are just being paid to help find the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] by the employer. With all their matters sorted, they are allowed through the blockade. Once out of earshot, Korrigan says, "So a murder ey?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
