### Overview
A fleet of pirates, a very old fleet that owns immeasurable riches. They control the seas and especially the area around [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. The captain of the fleet is known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Red Beard\|Captain Red Beard]].

The first mentioned near the start of the campaign in [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] as a potential way to get out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Then they were later mentioned by the family found in the [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] and indirectly caused the creation of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], however they are unaware of this fact.

They made their first appearance when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] attempted to travel to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] to make a trade deal. One of their members zip lined down from a flying ship, demanding protection money.

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | After travelling for most of the day at sea, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] see a huge ship with golden sales, most likely part of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]]. The sailor explained that if they managed to board, then they would most likely take all their money and kidnap [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] as a slave. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] quickly casts the [Gust of Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-gust-of-wind?srsltid=AfmBOorwXJ5zKU-E1NM_z-xkyOugDjkUXDfjqbrLN6fJRNdLAN0WsWXv) spell into the sale to make the boat go as fast as possible. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] if they would be able to call a whale to come and toe their boat so they could get away. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] tries his best but completely messes up the call; he does so so bad that he might have even scared most of them off. The larger boat starts to close in on them and is about 1000 ft away. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] spots some icebergs off in the distance that they could use to escape the fleet; he falsely assumes that their smaller boat would be quick enough to reach the icebergs in time. The large ship catches up quicker than expected and suddenly shoots a large metal claw onto the boat. It latches on through large wood splinters everywhere, damaging the boat. The large boat was about 40 feet away from them now. |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are sailing until a huge claw grabbed onto the boat from the sky and the captain said to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] that they needed to go inside and hide. they did and a member of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] flew on to deck. the demand protection money from the captain which had gone up without him knowing. Mordecai reveals him self to pay the extra not realising he would have to pay for himself as well - he very poor now. They sailed on without incident and landed on [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|ehobel]]. they were met by two Elves who charged everyone but chenris and Mordecai entry fees - chenris is now mega rich.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/02 The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | After a brief conversation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]], they can't decide weather to hire the goblins so they put it up to a vote with Chenris noting that they can use the goblin troupes as sacrificial pawns in the fight to make them easier to deal with later on. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] votes 4-1 with Kal being the odd one out to hire the goblins. They also decide that contacting [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] isn't worth it. [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] just isn't close enough to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to be able to make in time and the Fleet is just too unreliable. With that chenris motions for some guards to bring back the goblins and they agree to a deal. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had to physically force Korrigan to sign the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
