### Overview
A fleet of pirates, a very old fleet that owns immeasurable riches. They control the seas and especially the area around [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. The captain of the fleet is known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Red Beard\|Captain Red Beard]].

The first mentioned near the start of the campaign in [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] as a potential way to get out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Then they were later mentioned by the family found in the [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] and indirectly caused the creation of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], however they are unaware of this fact.

They made their first appearance when the party attempted to travel to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] to make a trade deal. One of their members zip lined down from a flying ship, demanding protection money.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | After travelling for most of the day at sea, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] see a huge ship with golden sales, most likely part of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]]. The sailor explained that if they managed to board, then they would most likely take all their money and kidnap [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] as a slave. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] quickly casts the [Gust of Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-gust-of-wind?srsltid=AfmBOorwXJ5zKU-E1NM_z-xkyOugDjkUXDfjqbrLN6fJRNdLAN0WsWXv) spell into the sale to make the boat go as fast as possible. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] if they would be able to call a whale to come and toe their boat so they could get away. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tries his best but completely messes up the call; he does so so bad that he might have even scared most of them off. The larger boat starts to close in on them and is about 1000 ft away. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] spots some icebergs off in the distance that they could use to escape the fleet; he falsely assumes that their smaller boat would be quick enough to reach the icebergs in time. The large ship catches up quicker than expected and suddenly shoots a large metal claw onto the boat. It latches on through large wood splinters everywhere, damaging the boat. The large boat was about 40 feet away from them now. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | After a brief conversation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]], they can't decide weather to hire the goblins so they put it up to a vote with Chenris noting that they can use the goblin troupes as sacrificial pawns in the fight to make them easier to deal with later on. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] votes 4-1 with Kal being the odd one out to hire the goblins. They also decide that contacting [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] isn't worth it. [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] just isn't close enough to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to be able to make in time and the Fleet is just too unreliable. With that chenris motions for some guards to bring back the goblins and they agree to a deal. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had to physically force Korrigan to sign the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
