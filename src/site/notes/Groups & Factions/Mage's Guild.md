| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | She confirms, saying it's uncharacteristically quick for the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]] since they need to still have a face for the nation, especially with how frequently new human rulers are selected. Korrigan tepidly asks if people like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or from the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]] can join in the running. She says that they would never have a chance since it is only the lords who can make a claim, and the mages guild is an international entity - leave all relieved. Before they head off, Chenris suggest leaving Drache and Aidan a note to explain what their plans are. Korrigan exclaims that he wants to try a new spell he learnt as he grabs a quill and paper and begins to write with the spell [Illusionary Script](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/illusionary-script) to encrypt the note so that only the party would be able to read it, to everyone else is "I am Aidan, and I am Stupid" as a prank on the man. The three all let out a big laugh before leaving their lodgings. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] | Ignoring this, Mordecai starts to perform a self-written ballad about [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]] to wet their appetite. People seem to enjoy it and even chuck some coins at him. While this is happening, drache sits at the bar (which is unusual for this establishment), asks for a class of wine, and watches the crowd. After Mordecai finishes his first Ballad, he starts another about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]; however, he purposely tries to get a lot of information wrong to see if anyone reacts. Most patrons are sitting there, enjoying the music -apart from one, an older man who starts disagreeing with many things Mordecai purposely gets wrong. Drache approaches him and they begin to chat about the true history of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Drache learns a lot and thanks him for his time. The person says, "No, thank you. It's been wonderful to talk about such things. If you wish to talk some more, just ask for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] at the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]]" and then walks off.  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] | As the two of them leave, Chenris asks a door clerk about the [[Master Enel Cubus\|Master Enel Cubus]]. The person says they unfortunately wouldn't know about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] in the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]] on the floor above them, but they might know more than them. Chenris thanks them for the information and laments that he doesn't have the time to ask further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
