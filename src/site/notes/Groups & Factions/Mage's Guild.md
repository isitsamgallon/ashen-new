| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | She confirms, saying it's uncharacteristically quick for the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]] since they need to still have a face for the nation, especially with how frequently new human rulers are selected. Korrigan tepidly asks if people like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or from the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]] can join in the running. She says that they would never have a chance since it is only the lords who can make a claim, and the mages guild is an international entity - leave all relieved. Before they head off, Chenris suggest leaving Drache and Aidan a note to explain what their plans are. Korrigan exclaims that he wants to try a new spell he learnt as he grabs a quill and paper and begins to write with the spell [Illusionary Script](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/illusionary-script) to encrypt the note so that only the party would be able to read it, to everyone else is "I am Aidan, and I am Stupid" as a prank on the man. The three all let out a big laugh before leaving their lodgings.    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Chenris speaks up and tells everyone present not to worry about this area of the battle field, gesturing broadly to the oceanic front behind [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], Stating he had a plan and needed to leave to make preparations. In the mean time, the rest of them should focus on getting more troupes for the war effort. With that, he turns on his heals, and leaves the war room, his destination? The [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]]. Once he reached his destination he approaches the clerk at the front desk and asks if there is anyone among their members that are proficient in large scare weather manipulation. The clerk mentions that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] is a strong mage with access to that magic but is not powerful enough to affect such a wide area as the elf described. They pause to think for a moment before tentatively suggesting to talk to a one [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] who can be found in the basement. Chenris thanks them for their time and goes to find this mysterious mage. |
