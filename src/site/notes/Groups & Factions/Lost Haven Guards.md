### Overview
The [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] Guards are a group predominantly comprised of [[Other Information/Races/Goliath\|Goliath]]s. They perform various functions, including bodyguards for the nobles, typical security and watch duties and policing; however, they are best known for their role running the slave camps and acting as slave masters. 

### Equipment 
The guards are always equipped with similar gear. All wear golden full plate armour and carry an incredibly heavy greataxe, a set of javelins and a utility dagger. The guards who work primarily in the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] also carry a long whip that they use to punish slaves. 

### Attitudes
#### Slaves
The guards are known for having a no-nonsense attitude when dealing with the slaves; they're quick to violence and tend to be overly cruel to the slaves, often seeing them as not people. 

A great example of this is when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] learn that no matter what, at a specific time in the evening, they will throw away all of the food. This is regardless of whether everyone has had a chance to grab a meal. 

#### Hunters
While still slaves, the guards will treat them a lot better, going as far as to separate the slaves from them with remarks like "you wouldn't want to be seen associating with 'them', would you?" [^1]

#### Nobels
The guards treat the nobles with incredible care and concern, most likely because they will be killed if they don't. However, this goes so far that they are hesitant even to fight back if they are actively being killed. They will drop everything if a noble commands them to do something, even if the request is non-standard or out of the blue.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | Their battle w[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|as lon]]g and difficult as the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] Guards stood firm; their strong armour and towering boards made it challenging to damage them. Even when they were able to hurt them, they somehow grew even stronger, absorbing damage better and better while their attacks hit harder. This battle was so harsh that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] witnessed something he hadn't seen since [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the war for the OFC's freedom]]: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] being knocked down. Although he got up, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] had diverted some of his power to keep [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] alive, staining the fight further in the guards' favour.                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] led their two bodyguards into the forest and to the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]]. Upon seeing a large opaque orb in the middle of the woods, the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] were very concerned, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] was dismissive of the claims and ordered them to follow through. One obeyed and followed suit while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to make an excuse, saying this was merely a safe place they set up to store their hunting gear while the roughs in the slum were dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Once both were within the spells' effects, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] unleashed their abilities on the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]. They were both initially confused about why they were being attacked and tried to deal with them by using the blunt side of their weapons, but after some goading by [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], they began fighting for real. However, the two were no match for two fully powered-up mages and soon were killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | While Chincheris healed himself back to health, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly realised that because the goliaths were so big, their armour could not fit them. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] suggested that they could sit on each other's shoulders to wear the armour, and he could use [[Admin/Spells/Speak with Dead\|Speak with Dead]] \|to get some answers out of them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wasn't convinced, pointing out that they could have just asked the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] and didn't have to kill them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | With the final question answered, the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]]'s corpse fell to the floor in a slump, prompting [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to comment on how morbid the situation was. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stated that this was just magic. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] then took the chance to cast [[Admin/Spells/Prestidigitation\|Prestidigitation]] on themselves to clean the blood and the armour from themselves. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly followed suit, complaining about how the blood was sticky and stained everything, expressing confusion about how [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | When removing the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]' armour, they noticed they both had tattoos on their chests, much like their slave tattoos. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] manages to walk them[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\| over ]]to the palace gates, but is a bit wobbly. A [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] stops them, casually asking where their next shift was. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] whispers to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that they have palace duty next and need to talk to the foreman first. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] hear the whisper but assume it's their stomach growling. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] jokes, saying that it was the beans. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] laughed, letting them and warning them to get a hold of it, as they didn't want to anger a noble with gross sounds. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Once inside, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] had any ideas on where to go, as they were once nobles. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] explained that he sadly had no idea, as [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] palaces differed significantly from the eleven. He stated that many [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] palaces did their best to hide their servants from view, so they should look in the servants' quarters if they wanted to get underground. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mo[[Lost Haven Guards\]]i]] nodded and walked down a few corridors. As they approached the servants' quarters, they noticed how the gold furnishings got fewer before disappearing as they reached a rickety old door.                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | When they entered the room, it was incredibly dark and dirty, with piles of straw for beds. Upon seeing a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] enter their living quarters, many of the servants ran away, crying out in fear, stunning [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] prompted them to keep walking, "Although sad, we can't do anything about it until we stop the antimagic field."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took a deep breath and continued forward, finding a tiny spiral staircase downward. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dismounted [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], and they dragged the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]]'s armour down the stairs to raise any suspicions. The stairs took them 5 minutes to get to the bottom, where they were greeted with an ancient wooden door with planks of hardwood nailed over it to stop it from opening. There was text written on it reading 'KEEP OUT'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | As he approached, he watched in horror as the robot's arm began to reach out and grab a crystal from the wall. He shot that one, exploding it. The arm knocked into the wall again, but didn't seem to care as it went for another crystal. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] rushed towards the robot to try and disable the arm, but he could not figure something out before the robot was close to putting another crystal in the machine. With no time left, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] grabbed an arrow and stabbed it into the crystal, destroying the robot and forcing him to take the full brunt of the[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\| blas]]t.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Suddenly, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne\|a man in ornate clothes]] and a decorated crown entered the room, cackling wildly. He ordered a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] to pick up the half-alive [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]]. He looked at his machine, saying, "It's alright, my pet. You put up a good fight." he then turned to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] "Well, you tried, and that's all we can hope for." And with a cruel laugh, he punched [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] unconscious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] agrees, "[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|They']]re not just going to whip us and send us on our way"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | "We will find a little [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] down here earlier, if you think that's a good idea. And we're going to ambush them. And we're going to get them," said [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] as he began to lay out his plan, "and then we rampage through the streets. I don't know. I'm making this up as I go, Dracker. But I'll be saying inspiring speeches the entire time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They started reviewing the plans and confirmed they would do their best to pick off the garirds one by one, loot the armour and weapons, and use the mines as bastions. They could then push slowly, only taking on challenges when they were nearly confident they could win. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] nodded in approval. He th[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|en ask]]ed if they would wait for [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to return. He explained that they weren't even sure if the two were alive or dead. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] nodded but explained there was nothing they could do about that now, and they just had to trust in their party.                                                                                                                                                                 |

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] decided to have a look inside while [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], Aidan, and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] stayed outside to keep a lookout. They quickly found that a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] was sitting outside one of the windows, listening to what was being said. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] used Primordial to tell [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] inside about the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] secretly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked the priest if he was aware he was being watched, and the priest exclaimed he was more than aware, saying, "You look at me cconfused.You assume that because they're [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]], they're not also part of a system? You assume that just because they're [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]], their draw to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is less?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] became even more confused as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that just because someone benefited from a system doesn't mean they enjoyed said system. The priest added that none of the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] got any of the [[Other Information/Money\|money]] made by the slaves, and most became [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] because the alternative was being one of the slaves. There are many followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] across many levels in society," said the priest with reverence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

We carved through the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]. There were 500 of us, armed and ready to overthrow the Clown. I mean, we just wanted to be free; we didn't want to be slaves anymore. It's the only solution we came up with. And then we got to the King."
