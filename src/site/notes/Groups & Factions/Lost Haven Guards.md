| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | Their battle w[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|as lon]]g and difficult as the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] Guards stood firm; their strong armour and towering boards made it challenging to damage them. Even when they were able to hurt them, they somehow grew even stronger, absorbing damage better and better while their attacks hit harder. This battle was so harsh that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] witnessed something he hadn't seen since [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the war for the OFC's freedom]]: [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] being knocked down. Although he got up, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] had diverted some of his power to keep [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] alive, staining the fight further in the guards' favour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] led their two bodyguards into the forest and to the [[Admin/Spells/Leomund's Tiny Hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]]. Upon seeing a large opaque orb in the middle of the woods, the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] were very concerned, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] was dismissive of the claims and ordered them to follow through. One obeyed and followed suit while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to make an excuse, saying this was merely a safe place they set up to store their hunting gear while the roughs in the slum were dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Once both were within the spells' effects, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] unleashed their abilities on the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]. They were both initially confused about why they were being attacked and tried to deal with them by using the blunt side of their weapons, but after some goading by [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], they began fighting for real. However, the two were no match for two fully powered-up mages and soon were killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | While Chincheris healed himself back to health, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly realised that because the goliaths were so big, their armour could not fit them. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] suggested that they could sit on each other's shoulders to wear the armour, and he could use [[Admin/Spells/Speak with Dead\|Speak with Dead]] \|to get some answers out of them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wasn't convinced, pointing out that they could have just asked the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] and didn't have to kill them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | With the final question answered, the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]]'s corpse fell to the floor in a slump, prompting [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to comment on how morbid the situation was. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stated that this was just magic. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] then took the chance to cast [[Admin/Spells/Prestidigitation\|Prestidigitation]] on themselves to clean the blood and the armour from themselves. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly followed suit, complaining about how the blood was sticky and stained everything, expressing confusion about how [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | When removing the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]' armour, they noticed they both had tattoos on their chests, much like their slave tattoos. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] manages to walk them[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\| over ]]to the palace gates, but is a bit wobbly. A [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] stops them, casually asking where their next shift was. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] whispers to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that they have palace duty next and need to talk to the foreman first. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] hear the whisper but assume it's their stomach growling. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] jokes, saying that it was the beans. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] laughed, letting them and warning them to get a hold of it, as they didn't want to anger a noble with gross sounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | Once inside, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked if [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] had any ideas on where to go, as they were once nobles. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] explained that he sadly had no idea, as [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] palaces differed significantly from the eleven. He stated that many [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] palaces did their best to hide their servants from view, so they should look in the servants' quarters if they wanted to get underground. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mo[[Lost Haven Guards\]]i]] nodded and walked down a few corridors. As they approached the servants' quarters, they noticed how the gold furnishings got fewer before disappearing as they reached a rickety old door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] woke up to their now familiar routine of a [[Other Information/Races/Goliath\|Goliath]] [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|Guard]] barging into their tent and marching down to the depths of the mines to mine for 11 hours. The only difference this time was that much of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]) had contracted a violent cough; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan seemed fine. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s cough seems much worse than the others. Once they were free from the mines, they went down to the mess hall to get their food for the day before it was thrown away. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lull\|Lull]] gave them a knowing wink while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was deep in thought about how they could fix the magic situation, and concluded that they would need some kind of distraction or reason for leaving [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], like joining the hunters, but none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] knew of a straightforward way to join the hunters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they all try tailing someone who was a part of the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia to see if he would lead them to the pub. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked if that would be wise, as it would be very obvious if a group of 5 were following one [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they take turns tailing the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] while the rest stayed back, and they could then swap out at various points to keep suspicions low. They agreed this was the best plan and soon found a [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] that fit the typical archetype for the mafia and began tailing them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the first to tail them and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to the church of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] finally spotted him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] who walked around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] for a while, almost as if they were patrolling. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was soon caught, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to a wooden gate, where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] paid two platinum coins to the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]], who let him through. As the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] walked through, he spotted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but did nothing about them. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | Everyone agreed and watched as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] went down the road and positioned himself so that the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] couldn't quite see him before calling out to them, saying there was a fight between the slaves; however, the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] refused to leave his post. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then snuck into the house, grabbed a bottle of alcohol, and used it to start a fire, which was enough to distract the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] long enough to let [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] slip through the gate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | With [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] bumping into [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], they hurriedly explained that the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia would be angry when they found out [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] escaped. They needed to leave as soon as possible. They quickly turned around to leave the hunterman quarters. Unable to see what was behind the gate, they decided just to walk through and hope the coast was clear. Walking through a large hall, a sudden hand grabbed [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]’s shoulder. It was the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] asking them where they were going. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly explained they were new to the area and were confused about where they were going. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]], looking quite pissed, muttered something about the slave team needing to do a better job with the onboarding process before telling the group to go back inside, as they wouldn't want to be associated with the rest of the muck who work the mines. They laughed in fake agreement and went back inside. They walked until out of sight before rushing through the quarters and finding an empty building far from [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]].                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | With little else to do, they claimed a room, caught each other up, and got some rest. They were all awakened to explosions and frantic shouting from the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] during the night. Looking outside, many of the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] were running towards [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], many leaving their posts empty. Taking this as their chance to meet with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], they joined the rush for the gates. As they made their way to the gate, they ran past a large stone gate that was the exit from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pulled the group to the side, saying that this was the perfect opportunity to leave [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] and find the source of the antimagic field. They both agreed and decided it was best for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], the two magically inclined party members, to leave while [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] returned to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|the Korrigan]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was stopped by a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] near the gate, who had been ordered to stand watch. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] told them that the hunt was off today due to a slave revolt. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that Agurd was told to go out on a hunt in case slaves escaped. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]], too tired to complain, told [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to get their bow and do what they were told. Upon seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s confused look, I told them to get a bow from the armoury; they just had to show their tattoo and would be given one. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was still confused and left for the armoury. The conversation gave [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] a chance to slip through and escape [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. They hid in a nearby bush waiting for [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to join them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] told the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] that they both needed weapons for a hunt. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] asked to see their tattoos, and they explained that they had been given a regular tattoo but sent to the huntsman area. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] muttered about how the wizards were useless and then explained that they would get the tattoos updated for them. In the meantime, he gave them a bow and armour and wrote down the lave tattoos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | As they approached the city, a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] questioned them about what they were doing; all of the lords were being kept in the city hall for their protection during the revolt. They said they were out on a hunting trip and were just returning. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] respectfully congratulated them on a successful trip and apologised that it had been cut short. As they reached the city hall, it was clear to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] felt out of their depth. Inside, the panic only got worse as their hands began to shake until they suddenly stopped. They took a deep breath.

On the way, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] grabbed a cloak and threw it back to billow in the window as he walked. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could stop a laugh escaping. Approaching the barracks, a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] outside polity asked what they needed. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], acting as a noble, explained that their hunting trip had been cut short due to the slaves. If they were to continue it, they would need some bodyguards. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] jumped up and ran inside to grab some to help. He returned with two [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] made a big of a show of inspecting them before saying they would be “serviceable”. He turned on the spot and began walking to the forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] had a quick look before pointing out one man who [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] instantly recognised as one of the people from the rebellion fighting force. His joy was overcome with dread as he realised that during the rebellion, this man had had his leg cut off by a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] as punishment; it was now replaced with a crude metal one. The man's face was also quite badly scarred, and half of one of his arms was also missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
