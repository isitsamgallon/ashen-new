| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] ignored them and asked who commanded these forces if no unified groups were in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]]. The Clerk explained that several large [[Groups & Factions/Nomad Families\|Nomad Families]] each maintained their own guards and armies on retainer. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then inquired if their role was to prevent another Sundering should it occur. He asked whether they regularly checked places like [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the Broken Throne. The Clerk responded that they had no part in that and mostly left it to external researchers, adding, "We used to, but for reasons, people stay here." |
