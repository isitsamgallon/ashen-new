### Overview
A mysterious group that first appeared in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] after the fall of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. Initially [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] assumed they were aligned with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] due to their clear flame motif. The group is actually personality cult around [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis Ignithar]], an ancient and powerful mage.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | After some travelling, they made excellent progress until they reached the old wall separating [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]] from the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. The wall was not well-maintained, with much of it severely eroded or completely missing in some areas. Most of the Dawn flags had also been taken down and replaced with the emblem of The [[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood Of The Sun]]. Seeing the symbol reminded [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis Ignithar]] and his promise to teach them magic. They pulled out the magic bell they had given him and rang it. The metal of the bell reshaped into a face and said, "You are currently number 698 in the queue," before switching to [hold music](https://open.spotify.com/track/35oiHtaPcjzqwx2gu9dx6a?si=0bb51f545de94ab3). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they should call back another time, but as they spoke, a distant, hollow toll echoed through the fog-choked air—a deep and resonant bell ringing with sorrow that clung to the bones. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | Once the old man’s spiel had concluded, the priesthood disappeared in an eruption of leaflets that rained down around their audience. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] rushed back to the group, transformed back into his humanoid form, and caught them up on this rogue religious group. The group ventured into the now empty hall to find a couple of leaflets left behind, labelling the group as the “[[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood of the Sun]]” with a tagline of “Remember the [[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Prince of Fire]]”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
