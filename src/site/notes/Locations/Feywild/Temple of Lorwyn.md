A grand and magnificent temple, crafted from exquisite marble and accented with radiant amethyst, stands as a beacon of architectural splendour. Inside, the temple is adorned with intricately woven tapestries and statues that celebrate the lore of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. A newly unveiled statue of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], holds a place of prominence, the chest cavity of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] is hollowed out and in its place is [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]]'s soul. Each statue within the temple is infused with magical enchantments, some speak and some move.
