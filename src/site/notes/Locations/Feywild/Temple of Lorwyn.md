### Overview
A grand and magnificent temple, crafted from exquisite marble and accented with radiant amethyst, stands as a beacon of architectural splendour. Inside, the temple is adorned with intricately woven tapestries and statues that celebrate the lore of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. A newly unveiled statue of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], holds a place of prominence, the chest cavity of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] is hollowed out and in its place is [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]]'s soul. Each statue within the temple is infused with magical enchantments, some speak and some move.

The Temple also holds the [[Locations/Feywild/Seelie Court\|Seelie Court]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was nearly in tears at this point, said that they could go to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and open the shop there. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] insisted that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't have Cancer, which only convinced them that they had "Death Disease". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say something else, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stepped in, saying that he had a way to make [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] feel better. They said they would be more than happy to have a distraction, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] teleported both of them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] waited in the [[Locations/Feywild/Temple of Lorwyn\|Temple of Lorwyn]] while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] found themselves in front of the familiar wooden shake in [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]]. They tentatively approached and knocked on the door, and the beautiful [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] they once knew was now very old, she instantly recognised them and invited them in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that they said they would return before asking what their name was they now realise they never got it when they were last here. She laughed before introducing herself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]]. |
