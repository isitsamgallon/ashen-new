### Overview
A part of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] which seems to be alive and can trap people in it for as long as it wants. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] notably got lost in the forest nearly 1,300 years in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]. This is also where they met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]].
