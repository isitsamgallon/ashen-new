### Overview
A part of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] which seems to be alive and can trap people in it for as long as it wants. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] notably got lost in the forest for nearly 1,300 years in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]. This is also where they met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was nearly in tears at this point, said that they could go to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and open the shop there. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] insisted that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't have Cancer, which only convinced them that they had "Death Disease". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say something else, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stepped in, saying that he had a way to make [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] feel better. They said they would be more than happy to have a distraction, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] teleported both of them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] waited in the [[Locations/Feywild/Temple of Lorwyn\|Temple of Lorwyn]] while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] found themselves in front of the familiar wooden shake in [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]]. They tentatively approached and knocked on the door, and the beautiful [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] they once knew was now very old, she instantly recognised them and invited them in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that they said they would return before asking what their name was they now realise they never got it when they were last here. She laughed before introducing herself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | With nothing left in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], they left the hut and set the animals free. They walked through [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]] for 500 years before finding [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] again. For him, it had only been a few hours, and he was enjoying his own chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]s approached, their youth returning as they walked closer to their friend. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asked if they were ok, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] explained their experience with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] and 500 of walking. When hearing how long they had been walking, they exclaimed that this was good as the death disease hadn't killed them yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
