The Feywild was a place of unrestrained and awe-inspiring natural beauty. The plane is always bathed in twilight of the setting (or perhaps rising) sun, with lanterns and fireflies providing additional, haunting lights. 

Visitors to the plane found that all sensations, both sensory and emotional, were heightened. Smells were stronger, colours were more vivid, and sounds were clearer, but at the same time shadows were darker and impulses were harder to control. Strong emotions even altered the landscape of the Feywild itself, wilting flowers trailed the despondent or furious and carefree animals travelled alongside chipper and cheerful individuals.

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] seems to be able to travel to and from this place whenever he pleases.
