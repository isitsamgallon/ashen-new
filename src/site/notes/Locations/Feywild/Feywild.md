### Overview
The Feywild was a place of unrestrained and awe-inspiring natural beauty. The plane is always bathed in twilight of the setting (or perhaps rising) sun, with lanterns and fireflies providing additional, haunting lights. 

Visitors to the plane found that all sensations, both sensory and emotional, were heightened. Smells were stronger, colours were more vivid, and sounds were clearer, but at the same time shadows were darker and impulses were harder to control. Strong emotions even altered the landscape of the Feywild itself, wilting flowers trailed the despondent or furious and carefree animals travelled alongside chipper and cheerful individuals.

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] seems to be able to travel to and from this place whenever he pleases.

Soon, hours turned into days, then days into weeks and over time, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] became much more enthusiastic about the chicken noodle soup again, as it was one of the few nutritious meals [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] could make in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they weren't in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], and time seemed to floor differently here. for them, it has been a week at most. they also explained how they had caught a disease called the death disease, and they wanted to re-tune and say a proper goodbye.

They walked through [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]] for 500 years before finding [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] again. For him, it had only been a few hours, and he was enjoying his own chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]s approached, their youth returning as they walked closer to their friend. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] asked if they were ok, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] explained their experience with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]] and 500 of walking.

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been everywhere in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], "from [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the [[Locations/The Desert/Broken Ember Throne\|Broken Ember Throne]]," impressing everyone. they then revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been involved in many of the world's recent events, including [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], and even joined the hunt for a missing [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]][^6].  Seeing that it was getting a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] excused themselves, not before promising to get revenge for them if they ever ran into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]] on their travels. Before leaving, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] performed a funeral rite for them and sent the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]]'s soul to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s as he felt that this would be the best place for a person who loves adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]              | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to calm him down and told him to start from the beginning and explain how their [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] works. After a few deep breaths, they explained that their version works slightly differently from the more common version. He functions by taking him through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s before appearing in the spot he wanted. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] paused for a moment before suggesting that maybe their ability malfunctioned and sent [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] but left them there. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] filed with his bow for a moment before saying that could be the case as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no way out of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and so could be trapped. A moment passed for [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s eyes widened in panic as he screamed, "OH MY GOD, [[The Party/Halfbie\|HALFBIE]] IS IN THE [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|FEYWILD]]!" before teleporting there himself. He landed in his usual spot: outside a golden temple dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He threw out his magic, searching for this friend and breathed a sigh of relief, and he sensed them moving to them slowly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] opened their eyes after the teleport, only to find themselves in a dense forest that they instantly recognised as the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. They checked the crystal to see if the plan at least worked, but in the hand was what looked to be a small rift that seemed to cut the very fabric of reality. Inside, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could see an inky black void that contained thousands of tiny stars and galaxies. More importantly, there was a weird magical session that sounded like a rift. On further analysis, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] realised in horror that magic was being sucked into the rift. Knowing that if too much magic was absorbed, there could be catastrophic consequences for not just the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] but the universe as a whole. Their worries were soon halted when they realised that the rift was quickly closing, and after a minute, the rift had disappeared. It was as if magic was repairing the rift, and as it wasn't that significant, it was a relatively quick fix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | With the rift resolved, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] turned their attention to their next problem: how they were going to leave the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. They were anxious to leave, as they were well aware of the dangers of these lands. They recognised the general area but weren't sure they knew exactly where they were. They decided to pick a direction and walk; theoretically, they should run into someone or some settlement at some point. Travelling through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s, they managed to stay safe through clever spellwork and ingenuity, surviving on berries or whatever animals they could hunt. The animals of the Fey were strange and almost uncanny like they either should exist or some mad scientist fused what they assumed two different animals should be like as the days turned into weeks, into months and months into years. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s mind began to unravel as they walked around aimlessly in the fairest way that would not stop moving and shifting. It was as if the very ground beneath them breathed, and the trees turned to look whenever they made a sound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

[[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked if the crystal vanished when they arrived at the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], as he didn't see it on them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] couldn't remember, so he flicked back through their notebook and was delighted to see they had kept a journal for the first 15 years. The journal detailed their rift to everyone, and as they read it, the memory came back to them, and they explained the situation in more detail. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tries to lighten the mood and asks if they learned anything interesting on their travels, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] replies with a massive grin, "Stew and noodles are real goodddd!!".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future.

He was surrounded by giant mushrooms that resembled trees more than the food he prepared for dinner whenever Chenris misbehaved. The ground was made of thick marsh that seemed to stretch on forever, and after a few confused, aimless steps, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] became stuck in the mud, slowly sinking down into a cold death. He struggled for what felt like hours as the mud consumed him [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]]. First, it took his legs, then his hands, his chest, and his arms, until he was left with nothing but a head on the ground, much like one finds when scavenging a battlefield for scraps and coin. Yet this head screamed for help that would never come. Soon, these screams ceased as the mud took his mouth, filling it with the vile taste of rot and disease. The mud was cold and unfeeling as it robbed the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] of his sense of smell next. When the mud slowly began to fill his ear canals, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] had nearly given up and accepted his fate. He was tired, tired of fighting, and just wanted to relax and live a peaceful life with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. As a burning sensation replaced the air in his lungs, his world went dark as he sank through a void that did not care about his plight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The orb broke the silence by saying they were happy to wait; in fact, they could teleport [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] into the room as soon as they were available. The orb then appeared very confused, looking flustered for the first time as it revealed that it was unsure of where the two were. The orb explained that it had knowledge of all the things that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] knew, yet had no idea where they were, which would have been impossible unless they were in a place beyond [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s control. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they go to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]’s room, but the orb revealed that this was still a location it could see. It might make sense if the two were taken to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. However, that was such a peculiar idea that the orb immediately dismissed it.  )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]]          | With Chenris nowhere to be found, the party decide to go on the offensive and try to imagine as many things as they can that they've seen on their adventures. Korrigan especially thinks about all the strange things found in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. This course the illusion to glitch before Korrigan is put in a black void where he hears "Stop being so annoying, have some time out" Korrigan shouts back to give him chenris back, its not like he could hurt either way. At that moment, Korrigan sees a window showing Chenris talking to a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Mysterious Man]] sat at a large table with a feast with many people pointing bows at chenris, read to kill him at any point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | As he enters the room he gives a guard the instructions he wrote earlier and told them to dispatch a small 3 man squad to carry out these instructions and emphasised the importance and swiftness needed to carry out everything to the letter. The guard rushes off and Chenris asks if they came up with any ideas. Korrigan offers that they could go to the  [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and try to enlist troupes form there as having the might of the fey creatures on their side could be enough turn the tide of the war. Chenris agrees and suggests they should head immediately to broker a deal, then once they have everything inline they will discuss the full war strategy. But before they can all leave Korrigan states there is one last bit of business to attend to. The group confused, ask what the boy means. With a large grin plastered on his face, he gleefully says "Well we can't go to war without knowing who betrayed us, can we?!" and summons Merek. Merek rushes in looking even more terrified than before, asking why he was summoned. Korrigan says "Why it's time to reveal your findings of course!". The halving stammers and chokes his way through saying that he didn't have enough time to figure it out. Korrigan is visibly mad, seeing this the halfling gets out the staff he was gifted the other day and shouts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Korrigan, satisfied with finally knowing what is going on, takes Chenris and Mordecai to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] and guides them to what is known as the [[Locations/Feywild/Seelie Court\|Seelie Court]]. A place priming with magical fey energy where all of the Arch Fey gather to discuss their plans. Its a large room and on the outskirts are seats for all the beneficiaries. Opposite the door, are 3 seats one presumable for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], one on her right Korrigan as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] and one her where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] - the head of the court is sat. She stands to announce that court is now in session.  With that the excited hubbub subsides to give space for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] speak, She asks what they want - noting that the non-fey are only here as they are with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]]. Each word escaping her mouth as if it was a challenge to even cordial in the presence of someone who can challenge her authority. Korrigan starts to explain their sudden need for the court to convene but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] cuts him off as she already knows what he wants and he can't have it. Mordecai speak up and after a long back and forth, manages to convince her to consider their plea. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] doesn't care for the well being a human nation but admits it might be funny to allow them to make their plea to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|feywild]] and see who answers their call if they make a deal with her. Korrigan asks what sort of deal she would like and confesses he only wants one thing: Chaos and instability. In return for calling on the fey for support he must see for chaos than normal. Korrigan instantly agrees before the other two can question what she means by this. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] laughs as the deal has been made. She excited exclaims that the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]'s magic is now even more unstable and will happen more often, Mordecai's jaw drops as he starts to panic. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | In the morning, Chenris is going for a walk, when he runs in to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]]. Chenris immediately tells Korrigan and not Mordecai because Mordecai is “a buzzkill”. Korrigan is furious, walks down the stairs and says "Remember me? " and takes Merek to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s in a puff of magenta smoke and laughter. Korrigan said that Merck owed him a debt as his actions resulted in his death. He asks him for his name, to which Merek declines. After trying a few times, Korrigan gives up and even gives him a gift Merek accepts, korrigan starts to manically laugh as the gift was accepted, binding Merck into a fey contract unknown to Merck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
