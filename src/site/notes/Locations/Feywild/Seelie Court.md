| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Korrigan, satisfied with finally knowing what is going on, takes Chenris and Mordecai to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] and guides them to what is known as the [[Locations/Feywild/Seelie Court\|Seelie Court]]. A place priming with magical fey energy where all of the Arch Fey gather to discuss their plans. Its a large room and on the outskirts are seats for all the beneficiaries. Opposite the door, are 3 seats one presumable for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], one on her right Korrigan as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] and one her where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] - the head of the court is sat. She stands to announce that court is now in session.  With that the excited hubbub subsides to give space for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] speak, She asks what they want - noting that the non-fey are only here as they are with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]]. Each word escaping her mouth as if it was a challenge to even cordial in the presence of someone who can challenge her authority. Korrigan starts to explain their sudden need for the court to convene but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] cuts him off as she already knows what he wants and he can't have it. Mordecai speak up and after a long back and forth, manages to convince her to consider their plea. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] doesn't care for the well being a human nation but admits it might be funny to allow them to make their plea to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|feywild]] and see who answers their call if they make a deal with her. Korrigan asks what sort of deal she would like and confesses he only wants one thing: Chaos and instability. In return for calling on the fey for support he must see for chaos than normal. Korrigan instantly agrees before the other two can question what she means by this. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] laughs as the deal has been made. She excited exclaims that the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]'s magic is now even more unstable and will happen more often, Mordecai's jaw drops as he starts to panic. |
