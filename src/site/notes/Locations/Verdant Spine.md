| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]]     | They soon entered [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]], a massive portside town that looked to be the largest city in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]] on this side of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]]. However, upon entering, they found that it resembled a barely populated fishing village rather than a bustling city. They decided it would be best to visit the local market to ask about their quest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]     | Once out of earshot but still being watched from afar, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exhaled, pleased that they had learned so many interesting things. They were particularly intrigued by the fact that Niaross significantly influenced the wall and [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]], which could mean [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]] had something to do with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tried to sense Terathera's presence from the wall but couldn't detect anything. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], looking closer at the wall and then The [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]], tried to understand if anything was happening. As far as they could tell, the stone had been taken from the mountain range, but it was nothing more than regular rock. After a long pause, they assessed that it was probably sedimentary rock, but no geologists were around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are getting ready to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] decides it would be best for him to scout the area out ahead of time and to meet him in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] when they can make it. The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | They discover that the name "Yakawa" refers to a temple at the top of the mountain, there is then a town surrounding it where people and pilgrims live or rest. The town is built on the mountain edge breaking the town into tiers going up the surface of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] with the shrine at the highest point. The town surrounding the shrine is protected by large palisade walls. It is currently late afternoon, so Drache suggests resting up now so they can sneak into [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] in the dead of night and have a better chance of rescuing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. They go to the Adventures Guild where two [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s are running the reception. Mordecai is unwilling to speak, not wanting to be accidentally noticed by anyone, so Drache is the one to ask for their usual two rooms. But once he is given the rooms, he insists they show him the way - something that is not typically at all, but they relent and awkwardly show them the way. Once shown to their room, Drache suggests having 'an emergency meeting' to discuss their plans. One of the receptionists comments "That's a weird name for a fivesome". Korrigan, forgetting that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was with them, says there are only 4 of them causing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to become mad at him again. She runs off stating that she'll get her own room. Korrigan tries to apologise but it's a lost cause. |
