| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] readied itself for the upcoming fight. They knew it was coming, and with many struggling to stay standing, they all knew it would be rough. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] looked especially nervous and tightened the string on his bow. He stood, feeling the weight of Sara's sword hanging from his waist. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] handed out the potions they stole from the magic shop in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]] and distributed them amongst [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Aidan, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] drank potions to recover some of their health. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] fared better and helped people rebuild and even commission a statue of the rebellion's symbol to be made out of some of the gold taken from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. And soon the symbol of a mouse with antlers was erected at the heart of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] [^1].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] stood at the gates to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]], ready to start the battle. Suddenly, Aidan caught up with them, explaining he had supported the rest of the revolutionaries, but it seemed they could use some help. They both gladly accepted his help. Before they charged in, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] made a discovery: Their magic was slowly returning. Upon realising this, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] let out a slow, maniacal laugh. His purple eye glowed with [[Other Information/Races/Fey\|Fey]] potential, and he drew his bow and fired his shot.                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | With the gates unguarded, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] led the way to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. Before crossing the threshold, he looked over his shoulder to check on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]], who seemed fine, having stayed on the sidelines during the fight. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], "All right, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]], what's the plan? We head straight to the palace? I think we have magic..."                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 45\|Session 45]] | His voice trailed off, and the antimagic field began to turn on again. Both looked at each other with concern. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suggested they get a move on and head for the palace, picking up some supplies along the way, gesturing to his numerous wounds left from the fight. They all agreed and crossed into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. It was a ghost town with all the shops abandoned. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] explained that many nobles run to the palace whenever there is danger. Aidan suggested they look for supplies in some shops.                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | "Thank you. That's good information right there. I will stop wearing irons on purpose. Would you be able to go..." He grabs the doctor on the shoulder." Would you be able to go and help the slaves? The miners? Heal them when you can? Um... And we will take some hunters and travel to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]." The doctor agrees and goes into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]] with his medkit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They approached the gate to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. A large group of [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] stood in front of it, brandishing weapons with steeled determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] were faced a decision: going left would lead to a woodland area, and going right would lead to a [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|fancy-looking city]]. The antimagic field was coming from the city, but they would need disguises to get inside. They decided their best bet was to leave the antimagic field so they could use magic to disguise themselves and grab some clothes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 41\|Session 41]] | The man explained that a few years ago, there was a rebellion, and a revolutionary force used magic to burn many of the doors down to let the slaves escape. When asked, the man explained the salves rose against the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] chimes in to clarify that the Laminar is the name of the inner sanctum where the elites live. Much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s dismay, their stuff was most likely stored in a museum for the rich people if it hadn't already been sold to the highest bidder.                                                                                                                        |
