| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]] | "Thank you. That's good information right there. I will stop wearing irons on purpose. Would you be able to go..." He grabs the doctor on the shoulder." Would you be able to go and help the slaves? The miners? Heal them when you can? Um... And we will take some hunters and travel to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]." The doctor agrees and goes into [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]] with his medkit.                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]] | They approached the gate to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. A large group of guards stood in front of it, brandishing weapons with steeled determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]] | The man explained that a few years ago, there was a rebellion, and a revolutionary force used magic to burn many of the doors down to let the slaves escape. When asked, the man explained the salves rose against the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] chimes in to clarify that the Laminar is the name of the inner sanctum where the elites live. Much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]'s dismay, their stuff was most likely stored in a museum for the rich people if it hadn't already been sold to the highest bidder. |
