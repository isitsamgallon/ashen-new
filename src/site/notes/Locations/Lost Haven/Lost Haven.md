#INFORMATION_MISSING_OR_OUT-OF-DATE 
### Overview
Nation found to the North East of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and home to one of [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. So far not much is known about this place except that it is ruled over by a tyrant king. There is very clear class divide within people, similar to the [Cast System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India).  [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] seems to hate the nation due to a rebellion that almost won in the city.

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] also revealed to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] that  [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal]] 'got a bunch of people killed' in Lost Haven.

The capital has a large library

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]     | Up to this point, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] had been careful while manoeuvring through the streets of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. Still, his care had been thrown away, and he acted on animalistic instinct as he searched through the raiment of his family's forge. When his search yielded nothing, he flew open the doors and rushed in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reached out to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] to try calming him down, but it was useless. Not wanting to leave [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] alone, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] followed suit into the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]     | "The King was behind me. We confronted again. He stabbed me multiple times before throwing my body into the ocean. I drifted for hours or days before I awoke on some rocks. Now I know I awoke at the rocks below the [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]]. I was hauled out of the water and saved by..." his voice trailed off again, for he said, "Fey creatures saved me. And then I ran, got on land, and started heading as far away from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as possible. I got to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and heard about a great guild called the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]], and the rest, you know, is history."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] excitedly ushered them all in and explained in more detail everything he had experienced since leaving [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. After he was done, one of the slaves asked why he hadn't come back sooner. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] looked very guiltily for a moment before explaining that the only time he could come back was when he was free of the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|ivory crest]], but he didn't want to until he was much stronger so he could come back and free everyone. He then explained that everyone in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] was powerful and had all the skills to make Malachi's life a living hell. They just needed to take down the antimagic field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]]     | Standing at the threshold of the Wyverns Cave, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] paused to get their bearings and figure out where they needed to go. The Tour Du Ashen's hands accounted for them discovering a teleporting dwarven room and venturing back to the Wyverns Cave. Studying the map closely and referring to an old book they found recently, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they travel to The [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]], not only would it give them easy access to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], but it would give them all a chance to catch up with an [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]] business partner and to learn what happened after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s death [^1]. The rest all agreed and began preparations to head off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]]     | After a few days of travelling, they finally saw the [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|emerald fort]]'s white walls and green banners. As they approached, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] became increasingly nervous. Reaching the gate, the guards stopped them, asking what their business was with the fort. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that they were allies from the war for the cause's freedom and wanted safe passage through to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. The guards quickly relaxed and explained they were more than welcome to enter, but if they wanted to travel to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], the fort just requested that they do it at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]]     | When pressed for a reason for this, the guards explained that the [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|Emerald Fort]] and [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] have a somewhat turbulent relationship. According to the guard, [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] would rather trade with the southern colonies, as the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]] had become too unpredictable. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pushed them further, and they admitted that the fort didn't want to be seen as fraternising with other nations too much; they were supposed to remain neutral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] began to panic as old memories of his time as an enslaved person here began to resurface.

Sylvia agreed to join them, stating that [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was known for polluting a lot, and it would be good to stop that by killing the king and killing everyone involved in destroying the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that one of his goals in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was to destroy the tower.

With a quick gesture, the spirit moved over to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's father, healing him slightly. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] lamented that even with this matter resolved, neither he nor his mother could ever return home. There was simply too much pain and distrust for him to do so. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's hand now rested on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's other shoulder, "You know, [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] may not be your home anymore, but that's okay because home is just a place where you are comfortable. Once upon a time, my home was probably [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and now it's some temple in a mysterious forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The Clerk confirmed it was possible but wasn't recommended, especially as they wouldn't be able to get back in this and would have to go through [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] or similar routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]". |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Most take the travel time to get some rest and heal up. Once [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] woke up, they immediately got out a piece of paper and started to write a letter but kept the details a secret from the rest of the group. Intrigued, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asks what he is writing, which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] says is none of their business. Turning very serious, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] explains that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] needs to be able to trust each other completely. He had already explained his secrets to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and it feels especially important now that their friend has died. He notably struggled with his emotions as he said the word friend. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs before explaining that he wants to start tying up loose ends and is writing a letter to his father. Having not heard much about [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] tentatively asks if he is on good terms with his father, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] remains tight-lipped about any details with his family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | When weighing up their options, Mordecai says, that whatever they do he can stay with Aidan and cast [Dispel Magic]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) If and when needed. Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Korrigan, feeling a bit lost and defeated, says that the party needs to trust each other and and to do that we need everything on the table. He starts to explain his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. She brought him back to life so he could settle his business in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] and make sure the tower in there falls. The party is stunned into silence.
