### Overview
A nation found to the East of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and the birthplace of [[The Party/Dead/Kal †\|Kal †]]. Lost haven is both the name of the nation and the city. the majority of the nation is made up of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] where a large slave population is housed and forced to mine coal and iron for the nation. The ruling class and the area where the noble's live is called [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]. 

### Society
#### [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]]
Acting as the name of both the group and the city, Luminara is where the Nobel's live. They're all shown to live in lavish luxury with comfortable clothes, food and slaves for their every beck and call. Many of them are unnecessarily cruel to their slaves and those who live in the slums. They ruled by the king, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi Darkthorne †]].

#### The [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]
A large salve camp where people a kidnapped and forced to work in the mines or hunt food for the nobles. The Camp is ran by the guards with and iron fist, but [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] also seem to have a lot of power and influence.

#### Diplomatic Relations
Lost Haven is known for not having great relations with the majority of the nations found with in the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]] [^1]. Due to a lot of the nations being 'unstable' with constant war and the recent destruction of key [[Other Information/The Towers\|Towers]], Lost Haven prefers trading with other nations like [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]] and those within [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. 

Due to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]'s relation with slavery and other interactions [^2], it can be presumed that Lost Haven is interested in return to business with the nation. 

### Other Information & Trivia
- The capital has a large library
- The location of one of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]

### History
6 years before the start of the campaign, a slave called [[The Party/Dead/Kal †\|KA1]] Started the Lost Haven Slave Revolt after his mentor, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Elandra †\|Elandra †]] was murdered by the king. His rebellion nearly worked but the guards got the upper hand and pushed the slaves back. The majority of his friends were soon killed and he was thought to be killed when the king stabbed him in the chest and through him into the ocean.

KA1, better known now as [[The Party/Dead/Kal †\|Kal †]] (or [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]), survived the attack and later returned with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to free all of the slaves and to destroy Lost Haven's Tower.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]]      | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] readied itself for the upcoming fight. They knew it was coming, and with many struggling to stay standing, they all knew it would be rough. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] looked especially nervous and tightened the string on his bow. He stood, feeling the weight of Sara's sword hanging from his waist. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] handed out the potions they stole from the magic shop in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Luminara\|Luminara]] and distributed them amongst [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]]. Aidan, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] drank potions to recover some of their health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]]      | They all entered the next courtyard, where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] stood atop a balcony overlooking them. His crooked smile emanated evil, and he let down and drew his weapon. The battle was long and complex as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] traded blows with the King of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. Although he wielded a weapon, his magics were much more deadly. Surrounding him throughout the fight was his Aura of Avarice, which caused anyone who entered to have their [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Senses\|senses]] attacked, making them look at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] in awe for his beautiful golden form. Lying a finger on him would hurt them without [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] having to do anything. Despite this, they pushed on, absorbing the waves of deadly attacks and psychic pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]]      | [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s arrow landed from his bow, hitting their mark accurately. At the same time, others thought of a battle in real space, while [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] also thought of a secondary struggle of wills and ideology between [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi]] and himself. He stood with the weight of his people's freedom on his shoulders. He ran with the cries of his friends as they were slaughtered mercilessly for a regime that could not hear their pleas. And nooked each arrow for every person who died of starvation, or had been whipped for trying to breathe or those that had gone to bed knowing they would not wake up when dawn broke. All of it was theirs, and all his might, [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Skills\|skills]], and knowledge were leveraged in this battle to free the slaves of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]]      | Soon, they gained enough confidence to leave their room and eat something while walking around the palace. They learnt that the slaves drove away the rest of the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|Lost Haven Guards]], but now there were riots on the streets as some tried their best to put together a governing body to sort out what would happen in the near future.

However, the two were no match for two fully powered-up mages and soon were killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]]      | While Chincheris healed himself back to health, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suddenly realised that because the goliaths were so big, their armour could not fit them. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] suggested that they could sit on each other's shoulders to wear the armour, and he could use [[Admin/Spells/Speak with Dead\|Speak with Dead]] \|to get some answers out of them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wasn't convinced, pointing out that they could have just asked the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] and didn't have to kill them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]]      | With the final question answered, the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]]'s corpse fell to the floor in a slump, prompting [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to comment on how morbid the situation was. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] stated that this was just magic. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] then took the chance to cast [[Admin/Spells/Prestidigitation\|Prestidigitation]] on themselves to clean the blood and the armour from themselves. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly followed suit, complaining about how the blood was sticky and stained everything, expressing confusion about how [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]]      | When removing the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]]' armour, they noticed they both had tattoos on their chests, much like their slave tattoos. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] manages to walk them[[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\| over ]]to the palace gates, but is a bit wobbly. A [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] stops them, casually asking where their next shift was. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] whispers to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that they have palace duty next and need to talk to the foreman first. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] hear the whisper but assume it's their stomach growling. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] jokes, saying that it was the beans. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] laughed, letting them and warning them to get a hold of it, as they didn't want to anger a noble with gross sounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] explained that he sadly had no idea, as [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] palaces differed significantly from the eleven. He stated that many [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] palaces did their best to hide their servants from view, so they should look in the servants' quarters if they wanted to get underground. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mo[[Lost Haven Guards\]]i]] nodded and walked down a few corridors. As they approached the servants' quarters, they noticed how the gold furnishings got fewer before disappearing as they reached a rickety old door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] prompted them to keep walking, "Although sad, we can't do anything about it until we stop the antimagic field."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dismounted [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], and they dragged the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]]'s armour down the stairs to raise any suspicions. The stairs took them 5 minutes to get to the bottom, where they were greeted with an ancient wooden door with planks of hardwood nailed over it to stop it from opening. There was text written on it reading 'KEEP OUT'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

He shot that one, exploding it. The arm knocked into the wall again, but didn't seem to care as it went for another crystal. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] rushed towards the robot to try and disable the arm, but he could not figure something out before the robot was close to putting another crystal in the machine.

They agreed this was the best plan and soon found a [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] that fit the typical archetype for the mafia and began tailing them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the first to tail them and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to the church of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] finally spotted him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] who walked around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] for a while, almost as if they were patrolling. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was soon caught, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to a wooden gate, where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] paid two platinum coins to the guard, who let him through. As the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] walked through, he spotted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but did nothing about them.                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]]      | Up to this point, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] had been careful while manoeuvring through the streets of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. Still, his care had been thrown away, and he acted on animalistic instinct as he searched through the raiment of his family's forge. When his search yielded nothing, he flew open the doors and rushed in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reached out to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] to try calming him down, but it was useless. Not wanting to leave [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] alone, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] followed suit into the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say that if the last one said, 'Remebere who owns you,' then this one couldn't possibly be good, but as they opened their mouths, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s anguished scream roared out of the dingy dark corridor and echoed out of the house and beyond. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shouted "BAD POEM, BAD POEM" before rushing to help [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], explaining that they needed to get out of here ASAP before the [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] came to investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 42\|Session 42]]      | Sitting down with their "Food," [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asked if anyone from the first rebellion was in the hall. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] had a quick look before pointing out one man who [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] instantly recognised as one of the people from the rebellion fighting force. His joy was overcome with dread as he realised that during the rebellion, this man had had his leg cut off by a [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guard]] as punishment; it was now replaced with a crude metal one. The man's face was also quite badly scarred, and half of one of his arms was also missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

He stood up and screamed, "[[The Party/Dead/Kal †\|Kal]]," before rushing over in anger. [[The Party/Dead/Kal †\|Kal]] tried to give him the hint to be quiet, but they were behind him in no time and threw him across the mess hall. The [[Groups & Factions/Lost Haven Guards\|guards]] around them suddenly drawn their swords as they got ready for a fight. The man took the hint and apologised for the outburst. The man walked over and gave [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] a hand up [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] also played a long insinuation that it was a magic trick or something similar.

With a quick gesture, the spirit moved over to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's father, healing him slightly. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] lamented that even with this matter resolved, neither he nor his mother could ever return home. There was simply too much pain and distrust for him to do so.

She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]". |

They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Once [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] woke up, they immediately got out a piece of paper and started to write a letter but kept the details a secret from the rest of the group. Intrigued, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] asks what he is writing, which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] says is none of their business. Turning very serious, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] explains that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] needs to be able to trust each other completely. He had already explained his secrets to [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and it feels especially important now that their friend has died. He notably struggled with his emotions as he said the word friend. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs before explaining that he wants to start tying up loose ends and is writing a letter to his father. Having not heard much about [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] tentatively asks if he is on good terms with his father, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] remains tight-lipped about any details with his family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

They also want to find out more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Korrigan, feeling a bit lost and defeated, says that the party needs to trust each other and and to do that we need everything on the table. He starts to explain his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. She brought him back to life so he could settle his business in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] and make sure the tower in there falls. The party is stunned into silence.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 13\|Session 13]] | Chenris is quick to enter his trance state while the others stay awake, conflicted with the sudden change of events. They complain about chenris recent behaviour, alarmed that he has been getting worse and worse with his disrespect and insatiable drive for knowledge that has gotten them in difficult situations a few times. They decide to explore the house and eventually find a small library in one of the rooms. Mordecai and Korrigan are perusing the books before their eye widens in shock. There was a book on the shelf named “Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly” which was written by Kal, Sera and Thorn. Mordecai vaguely remembered the name  Sera from the black ritual and Korrigan was familiar with his old name of Kal. They excitedly brought it back to the group as they showed everyone. Korrigan was especially excited as this was an actual link to his past that could help him with his mission in Lost Haven. After some time, their exhaustion got the better of them and they went to bed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
