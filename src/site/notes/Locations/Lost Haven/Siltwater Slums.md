| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]] | After helping make the Molotov cocktails, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] drew a detailed map of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|the slums]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] pointed out choke points they could use. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] turned to Aiden, pointing at the wall where the bow and armour were, and asked him to sneak down to grab them.

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] reassuringly puts a hand on [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s shoulder before nominating himself to help the slaves organise.

The only difference this time was that much of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]) had contracted a violent cough; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Aidan seemed fine. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s cough seems much worse than the others. Once they were free from the mines, they went down to the mess hall to get their food for the day before it was thrown away. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lull\|Lull]] gave them a knowing wink while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was deep in thought about how they could fix the magic situation, and concluded that they would need some kind of distraction or reason for leaving [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], like joining the hunters, but none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] knew of a straightforward way to join the hunters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | After the meal, they decided to try heading for the doctors. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] led the way to where he remembered the doctors being located, only to find them closed and the building rotting into the ground. On the door was a message scratched in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]]. Aidan, who spoke the language, translated it to say ‘Doctors moved to [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]]’. None of them knew where this could be, so they tasked Aidan with trying to learn more about the place. However, anytime he asked about the place, most people refused to talk to him, and the only thing he learnt was that it was a pub and was most likely run by the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|Goblin]] Mafia, something he worked out from the fact that all around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] were adverts, written in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]], for joining the mafia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they all try tailing someone who was a part of the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia to see if he would lead them to the pub. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked if that would be wise, as it would be very obvious if a group of 5 were following one [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they take turns tailing the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] while the rest stayed back, and they could then swap out at various points to keep suspicions low. They agreed this was the best plan and soon found a [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] that fit the typical archetype for the mafia and began tailing them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the first to tail them and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to the church of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] finally spotted him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] who walked around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] for a while, almost as if they were patrolling. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was soon caught, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to a wooden gate, where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] paid two platinum coins to the guard, who let him through. As the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] walked through, he spotted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but did nothing about them. |

The room was medium-sized and filled with goblins, all brandishing weapons.

| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | With little else to do, they claimed a room, caught each other up, and got some rest. They were all awakened to explosions and frantic shouting from the guards during the night. Looking outside, many of the guards were running towards [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], many leaving their posts empty. Taking this as their chance to meet with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]], they joined the rush for the gates. As they made their way to the gate, they ran past a large stone gate that was the exit from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] pulled the group to the side, saying that this was the perfect opportunity to leave [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] and find the source of the antimagic field.

The guard told them that the hunt was off today due to a slave revolt. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that Agurd was told to go out on a hunt in case slaves escaped. The guard, too tired to complain, told [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to get their bow and do what they were told. Upon seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s confused look, I told them to get a bow from the armoury; they just had to show their tattoo and would be given one. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was still confused and left for the armoury. The conversation gave [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] a chance to slip through and escape [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]].

| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | Watching his friends safely go through the gate, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] returned to the house with all the alcohol in it, grabbed as many bottles as he could, and returned to their tent. Inside, he began fashioning [Molotov Cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail). [[Named Characters & Beasts/Misty\|Misty]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] helped make them. While making them, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tish\|Tish]] explained that the wooden gate went to the huntsman's quarters. After the slave revolt, they were separated from the main slave population to help prevent another one. Once all the Molotov Cocktails had been made, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] attached long fuses to them and placed them all over [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]], mainly in abandoned buildings and near the wall. He wanted to create a distraction to help the other escape.

The speech was short but incredibly insulting to all the slaves in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]]. Each insult was met with further insults from the crowd or a round of applause. Finally, the king explained what the punishment would be for their revolt: “I decree that one from each household shall be slaughtered to set an example of what happens when filth tries to fight back” The crowd erupted in a deafening applause as the king returned to his palace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] sat momentarily to think of the best way to explain his story. "So I guess it all began 28 years ago, when I was born here in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] as KA1 to my father, Ray. My mother died during childbirth. As soon as I could walk, I was transferred into labour, as is usual here. I was initially sent down to the mines, but I was allergic to something in the mines, so they sent me to work in my father's forge, which is where we were yesterday. I was also allergic to something in there, so I was designated to die until I was saved by a huntress called Alandra."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
