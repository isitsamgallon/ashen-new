### Overview
The laughing Miner was a small tavern located in the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Hunter's Quarters\|Hunter's Quarters]] within [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] and served as the base of operations for the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] that operated out of the [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]].

The tavern did not exist when Kal was growing up in Lost Haven.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | After the meal, they decided to try heading for the doctors. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] led the way to where he remembered the doctors being located, only to find them closed and the building rotting into the ground. On the door was a message scratched in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]]. Aidan, who spoke the language, translated it to say ‘Doctors moved to [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]]’. None of them knew where this could be, so they tasked Aidan with trying to learn more about the place. However, anytime he asked about the place, most people refused to talk to him, and the only thing he learnt was that it was a pub and was most likely run by the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|Goblin]] Mafia, something he worked out from the fact that all around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] were adverts, written in [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]], for joining the mafia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] all gathered to discuss what they had seen. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested waiting to see if the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] returned from the gate, and they could try to talk to them and see if they could gain entrance, and [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]] could be through that gate. They all agreed, and after an hour or 2, a group of goblins, including the one they had followed, exited and started to do the same route as the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] had before. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] motioned for the rest to hold back while they approached the group. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] told them that if they heard flute playing, that was [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s cry for help, and they should come ASAP. They all nodded, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] slowly approached the group, who had gone down a nearby alleyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]] | With [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] bumping into [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], they hurriedly explained that the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia would be angry when they found out [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] escaped. They needed to leave as soon as possible. They quickly turned around to leave the hunterman quarters. Unable to see what was behind the gate, they decided just to walk through and hope the coast was clear. Walking through a large hall, a sudden hand grabbed [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]’s shoulder. It was the guard asking them where they were going. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly explained they were new to the area and were confused about where they were going. The guard, looking quite pissed, muttered something about the slave team needing to do a better job with the onboarding process before telling the group to go back inside, as they wouldn't want to be associated with the rest of the muck who work the mines. They laughed in fake agreement and went back inside. They walked until out of sight before rushing through the quarters and finding an empty building far from [[Locations/Lost Haven/The Laughing Miner\|The Laughing Miner]]. |
