### Overview
The last surviving dwarven stronghold in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. The foot was established during the [[History & Events/Eras/4th Era\|4th Era]] by Dwarf King [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Dhuggith Broadcloak †\|Dhuggith Broadcloak †]] amidst the decline of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]]. Dhuggith, seeking power as the empire fractured, ventured north into uncharted, icy territories. There, he constructed Fort Moldan and utilized the steam geysers from local hot springs to forge a mechanical army. This automaton force became a key tool in Dhuggith's campaign to conquer northern dwarf villages, consolidating his control over the region.

The creation of the mechanical army at Fort Moldan had unforeseen consequences. As Dhuggith's army advanced, many human slaves in the north were unintentionally freed. These liberated individuals took up arms and began overthrowing dwarf-controlled towns and cities, contributing to the growing instability of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]].

Fort Moldan's role in Dhuggith's rise was significant but short-lived. The expansion of his mechanical army alarmed the southern lords, leading to a major confrontation known as the [[History & Events/Battle of Earthgrog\|Battle of Earthgrog]]. Although the southern forces managed to defeat Dhuggith's army, they suffered enormous losses, signaling the imminent collapse of the empire.

Despite Dhuggith's efforts to maintain his power from Fort Moldan, his reign was brief. His death two years after declaring himself emperor marked the end of Fort Moldan's military prominence, as the region entered a period of reconciliation and rebuilding under new leadership.
