| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | The atmosphere shifts to one of awkward silence as Aidan breaks the stillness, inquiring about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s enjoyment of their travels with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] expresses contentment with their adventurous experience alongside interesting companions, although they voice some guilt for having seemingly abandoned their duties with the [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] mages. When Aidan seeks clarity on the nature of these duties, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admits their ignorance, stating they were only informed that magic users were needed for an expedition, stirring their desire to leave [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], recalling her own family background, inquired about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s parents. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed that they wanted to earn money to support their family in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]]. Although they had limited financial resources, they shared what little they had. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] mentioned her own tragic family history, stating that her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] had passed away shortly after her birth, and she did not know her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|father]] until after his death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are all getting into the carriage, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] asks [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] where they are originally from, and after a thing, they explain they are from a small island town called [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], a nation none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever adventured to or heard of. Before the carriage starts to move, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is told in no uncertain terms that they are not to touch anything, especially any old books or notes (Referring to Chenris' notes and items). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] promises they won't. It was about a half-a-day journey from what was [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], and the airship was a few hours from the town. Along the way, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asks why they don't think they're part of the fey when they have the features of one. |
