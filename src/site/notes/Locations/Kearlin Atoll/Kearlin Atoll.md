| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | Passion [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered two men in incredibly fashionable and interesting clothing [^1]. The two men have a lunch caravan with huge piles of colourful silk. The men stop and proudly ask if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] would be interested in investing in their futures. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] falls for them and says they would. The men introduce themselves as businessmen for [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]] and begin to describe the concept of silk to them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is quick on the uptake and says they're quite familiar with silk, mostly the fabric made in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The men admit that this silk isn't as nice as their Elvin silk, but it is a lot cheaper than the stuff from the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]].                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | During a conversation about wealth, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] shared their contrasting experiences growing up. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] discussed the living conditions in much of [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], where many individuals reside in tents due to financial hardships. This revelation shocked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]], who found it difficult to fathom sharing such a confined space with others. She noted this experience in her journal, recognizing it as an aspect of life she had not considered prior to leaving the palace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are all getting into the carriage, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asks [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] where they are originally from, and after a thing, they explain they are from a small island town called [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], a nation none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever adventured to or heard of. Before the carriage starts to move, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is told in no uncertain terms that they are not to touch anything, especially any old books or notes (Referring to Chenris' notes and items). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] promises they won't. It was about a half-a-day journey from what was [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], and the airship was a few hours from the town. Along the way, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asks why they don't think they're part of the fey when they have the features of one. |
