| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 52\|Session 52]] | "The [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]]", [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] said matter-of-factly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]   | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] emphatically argued that it could be incredibly beneficial for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] to invade the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]] to the north of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Their main argument was that it could solve two birds with one stone. The pirates of [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the Golden Fleet]] had terrorised the waters towards the north of the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]] by attacking ships and demanding protection [[Other Information/Money\|money]]. Because of this, they were known for being one of the wealthiest groups in the material plane.                         |
| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]   | They quickly changed the topic and asked Tereance if he would be willing to help them raid the [[Locations/Golden Fort\|Golden Fort]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] escaped. They had books about how Terenace helped [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] win the war for the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|ofc]]'s freedom by manipulating the weather. They wondered if he could do the same during the raid to support the effort. The wizard chuckled and explained that he wasn't actually responsible for the weather; he was only there to keep [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] in check and focused on the spell. |
