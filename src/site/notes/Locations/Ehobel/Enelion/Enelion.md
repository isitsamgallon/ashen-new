| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 13\|Session 13]] | The next day the group made it to the coastal town of Enelion. Everyone is exhausted and decides it is for the best to rest up at the local inn. Approaching the the front desk Chenris enquires in elvish about rooms. She says there are many rooms available but she is confused about their party make-up as there are so many different races in it - especially a human one. Chenris explains that they are his guards. "And the human?" she enquired. And with a smirk, he said Aidan was his slave, he figured it would be an easy way to get revenge. She says very good, there a slave quarters down the hallway, it's in the basement. Aiden is unaware of what is being said about him as he doesn't speak English but quickly grasps the situation when hoteliers start escorting him to the slave room. The rest ask where Aiden is being taken. Chenris laughs before informing them of the news, “Just a spot of revenge, I’m sure he’ll be fine. I’ll even cover the room” the elf said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 13\|Session 13]] | As they are leaving the inn they ask the clerk how one might get an audience with the Emperor which she doesn't know but assumes it can’t hurt to have the backing of some of the monarchs. One of them, Folre Enelion IV Esquire, is often found on the beaches outside. They find the lord along the beach surrounded by at least 30 women, who on closer inspection are all under the charm spell, meaning they are not here of their own free will. This makes Korrigan irate but the rest of the party manages to calm him down and take him away. Chenris approaches the man, greeting him with a traditional Nobel Elvin greeting. Enelion is a very fat and disgusting man who is incredibly sexist as well as very pro-slavery. Chenris dances around the subject before picking his moment to ask for some kind of favour to meet the Empress. Chenris explains that he, and his concierge, are on a diplomatic mission from another country to make a trade deal but weren’t given many resources to complete the mission. The Lord gives a Harty laugh before looking at the rest of the party incredibly confused. “Why is your party made up of so many halfbreeds and… a human”. Chenris’ mind raced to come up with an excuse before saying, “Meat shields, wouldn’t to deface by perfect skin in a skirmish, would I” |
