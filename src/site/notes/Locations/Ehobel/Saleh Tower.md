### Overview
Seems to be one of [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and is found in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. It's very old tower is in a state of disrepair due to being so old. It was built before [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] and unlike other towers that are known to have a power source, the crystal at the centre of the tower doesn't have one. 

When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] visits this tower [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] uses [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2258-speak-with-animals) and managed to make contact with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]
