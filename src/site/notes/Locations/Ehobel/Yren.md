| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]] | The town [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had landed in was a coastal resort town call [[Locations/Ehobel/Yren\|Yren]]. They manage find a small show that sold potions and managed to barter a deal that Aidan would ages some wine in return for a health potion. Afterwards they move along with new potion (that chenris puts in his [[Other Information/Unique Items/Alchemy Jug\|Alchemy Jug]] to make infinite potions). As they're leaving the town, the gaurds warn them to never leave the paths since there are a lot of "Foul" things in the woods, especially at night. |
