| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] | On their way to the Inn, the group start to talk. Mordecai is annoyed that Chenris and Korrigan have been keeping secrets from the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], so he wants to learn as much as possible to outsmart Chenris at their game. Plus, it would prove to Chenris that book smarts isn't the be-all and end-all to research and smarts. The group agrees. Once they get to the [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Wooden Hearth Inn\|Wooden Hearth Inn]], Drache requests that the inn turn off their juke box to allow Mordecai to perform (if he didn't, Mordecai would've started pushing buttons to find out.) The bar gladly lets them as they love live performances, especially from "other folk". |
