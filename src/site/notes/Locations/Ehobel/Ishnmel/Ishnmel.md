### Overview
The Capital city of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and home to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] and the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]]. [[Locations/Ehobel/Irs Thalor\|Irs Thalor]] used to be the capital of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] but the cite was moved to be around the tower to make it easier to defend. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first visited in an attempt to create a trade deal between the lands of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] after [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]     | Before he could respond, she clicked her fingers, and an image materialized in the air. The vision was hard to look at, as if it broke the very rules of reality, but it clearly depicted his hand in the destruction of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|the Tower of Ishnmel]]. He watched in horror as his body became slowly overtaken by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], ultimately floating into the air and causing various large time rifts throughout [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]]. The sight was chilling, especially since he had never witnessed the destruction he caused from this perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | After some talking, it was revealed that the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] used to do a lot of research on [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]], specifically [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] before they were kicked out of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] for causing too much hassle for the guards and priests. Most of their research had been taken or was locked away by the university, so the engineers couldn't be of much help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then asked if it was possible to see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], the headmaster, reasoning that he must know something about this research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | With a heavy sigh, the headmaster explained that, yes, Agolin had once been a student at the university. He was known to be powerful, but he had two other friends who were a lot more gifted mages, especially in combat, which meant his friends were sent to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] and, therefore, died there. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] murmured that it finally made sense [^7]. The headmaster continued his explanation and said that the beings who stole the crystals were known as '[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]', which explained why the ghosts called them [[Other Information/Lightbearers\|lightbearers]] when they came to the crystals in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]] and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | Looking slightly pissed off now, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] surmises that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants them to destroy the tower and then kill him so he doesn't have to deal with the fallout - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] agrees. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] analyses the tower and notes that the crystal isn't at the centre of it like the others. Instead, the crystals line the walls and focus on the tower. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] touches on them, and a husky and laboured voice whispers to him, "[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]." [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s head snaps in the direction of the voice, and it is one of the black wraiths they saw in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordacai also recognise them from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Chenris enters a portal and there is notably no fog that clouds his judgement. He is in an empty marble room with a man with a staff standing in the middle. The man introduces himself as the person who controls all of the illusions. He invites Chenris to sit down and chat. Chenris joins him at the nearly summoned banquet table. The man gets straight to he point and asks why is chenris trying to ruin the illusion. Everyone seems happy with it. why not just leave it be. Chenris states that he is not trying to ruin it. His party have quite a lot of things to do and they just want to leave and get on with this lives. At this this the man brings out a a [[Locations/Strixhaven\|strixhaven]] dossier and states, he has been researching the party. although they have done some good, they have also done a few "… counterproductive actions" in reference to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] have just met up outside the palace and decided that their best course of action is to leave the city before anyone finds out that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] has gone missing. As they walk through [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] talks to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about the stars and tells the folktales of how they came to be through great warriors and researchers. One of these stories talks about friends leaving [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] feeling sad since she has never had friends due to not being allowed out of the palace. Mordecai says that ok because [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] will be her friends and she is overjoyed at the fact that she has made her first friends. She tries to give them money for this but Mordecai and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] refuse since that is not what friends are about (instead they say it's about trade deals between nations). However, she insists on giving a gift but laments that the only thing she has on her is a special [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Emerald Swan Amulet\|Amulet]] her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] gave her. Reading from a book she tells [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] the story of the amulet: |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided to go straight to the palace and see if they can get a an audience with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|The Empress]]. As they approach, they realise that Mordecai is the only person with [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic), and can stop [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] and as he is a human, he probably wouldn't be welcome in the palace. Chenris, Korrigan and Drache approach the The Empress' chambers and ask the guards if they've able to have an audience with her. He states that The Empress is not to be disturbed and isn't taking visitors. After a few attempts at convincing the guard they manage to convince both him and the empress that they should talk a because they know of an threat to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | They enter her room and are greeted by a large room filled from head to toe with books. Chenris walks in and addresses her with royal decorum (She doesn't care), Drache gives a short bow and Korrigan just stands there and waves. She asks what they need to tell her. Chenris explains the threat of the bandit camp and their weapon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Grom\|Grom]] and she asks for them to show her on a map and puts a large map on the floor. Chenris uses [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) to point to the spot on the map. He then talks about [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] that had fallen the night before. She says that she remembers reading about the tower but doesn't seem too concerned by it falling. Chenris asks why and she remarks that if it was stopped before than it can be stopped again. Chenris responds by saying he's not so sure since it read to him that [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] won mostly out of luck. She doesn't agree but respects his opinion.                                                                                                                                                |
