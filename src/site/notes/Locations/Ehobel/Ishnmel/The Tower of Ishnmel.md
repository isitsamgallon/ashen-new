The Tower of Ishnmel was one of [[The 5 Towers\|The 5 Towers]] that were constructed after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]]. Found at the centre of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], near the palace and the great library it truly a beautiful sight as seemed like the tower had been builtin within a tree and was filled with natural energy.

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Tower]] is no longer standing due to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]'s research going too far as he tried to destroy the crystal found at the top.
