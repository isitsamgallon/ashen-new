### Overview
The Tower of Ishnmel was  constructed after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]]. Found at the centre of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], near the palace and the great library it truly a beautiful sight as seemed like the tower had been built in within a tree and was filled with natural energy.

[[Other Information/The Towers\|The Tower]] is no longer standing due to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]'s research going too far as he tried to destroy the crystal found at the top.

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | After some talking, it was revealed that the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] used to do a lot of research on [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]], specifically [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] before they were kicked out of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] for causing too much hassle for the guards and priests. Most of their research had been taken or was locked away by the university, so the engineers couldn't be of much help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then asked if it was possible to see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], the headmaster, reasoning that he must know something about this research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | With a heavy sigh, the headmaster explained that, yes, Agolin had once been a student at the university. He was known to be powerful, but he had two other friends who were a lot more gifted mages, especially in combat, which meant his friends were sent to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] and, therefore, died there. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] murmured that it finally made sense [^7]. The headmaster continued his explanation and said that the beings who stole the crystals were known as '[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]', which explained why the ghosts called them [[Other Information/Lightbearers\|lightbearers]] when they came to the crystals in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]] and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | Looking slightly pissed off now, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] surmises that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants them to destroy the tower and then kill him so he doesn't have to deal with the fallout - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] agrees. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] analyses the tower and notes that the crystal isn't at the centre of it like the others. Instead, the crystals line the walls and focus on the tower. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] touches on them, and a husky and laboured voice whispers to him, "[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]." [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s head snaps in the direction of the voice, and it is one of the black wraiths they saw in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordacai also recognise them from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Chenris enters a portal and there is notably no fog that clouds his judgement. He is in an empty marble room with a man with a staff standing in the middle. The man introduces himself as the person who controls all of the illusions. He invites Chenris to sit down and chat. Chenris joins him at the nearly summoned banquet table. The man gets straight to he point and asks why is chenris trying to ruin the illusion. Everyone seems happy with it. why not just leave it be. Chenris states that he is not trying to ruin it. His party have quite a lot of things to do and they just want to leave and get on with this lives. At this this the man brings out a a [[Locations/Strixhaven\|strixhaven]] dossier and states, he has been researching the party. although they have done some good, they have also done a few "… counterproductive actions" in reference to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 16\|Session 16]] | They enter her room and are greeted by a large room filled from head to toe with books. Chenris walks in and addresses her with royal decorum (She doesn't care), Drache gives a short bow and Korrigan just stands there and waves. She asks what they need to tell her. Chenris explains the threat of the bandit camp and their weapon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Grom\|Grom]] and she asks for them to show her on a map and puts a large map on the floor. Chenris uses [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) to point to the spot on the map. He then talks about [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] that had fallen the night before. She says that she remembers reading about the tower but doesn't seem too concerned by it falling. Chenris asks why and she remarks that if it was stopped before than it can be stopped again. Chenris responds by saying he's not so sure since it read to him that [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] won mostly out of luck. She doesn't agree but respects his opinion. |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] | When the two groups meet, Chenris and Korrigan notice immediately that Aidan is not with them and ask about his whereabouts. At that very moment, weird magical energy spikes and space-time distortions break all over [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], with the biggest one being over [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. In the distance, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] can see Aidan flying up with distortions all around him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] | Out of desperation, Korrigan returns to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] to protect. Chenris deduces that this is the work of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and shouts out his name to taunt it. He doesn't reply. However, chenris realises that these distortions are what [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] uses to sap the lifespans out of people. And managed to pull Korrigan out before he loses too much of his lifespan(?). The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decide to catch up with Aidan and try to help him. Aidan's body currently has a large black smile across his face. Chenris also approaches and fires off a [Chill Touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2026-chill-touch) to break the concentration of whatever controls him - it doesn't work. Finally, Mordecai can free Aidan by casting [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic). With him free, they rush back to the tower to stop that distortion from destroying it. Aidan puts a stop to it and collapses from exhaustion.  |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Chenris and Korrigan wake up early and decide that they should check out [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] for themselves now that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is there to stop them from doing [REDACTED]. They rush over to the tower to find it's very different from most towers, with most of it being made up of a tree. They see a person in a white robe and ask them about the tower and its history. They find out the following:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
