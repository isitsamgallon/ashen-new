The home nation of the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]] in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and led by The Empress, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] took over the role of Empress from her mother [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]] some years ago. He is described in books as a very kind and understanding ruler and has "grand military plans". In reality, She doesn't leave the palace enough to understand the situation of her lands, let alone what was happening with her people. Ehobel was one of the main factions that made up [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. During this period Ehobel had a very good relationship with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] after many wars. However, sometime after the Sundering, the nations began to despise each other again, causing [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] which sprouted the offshoot nation called The [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | Passion [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered two men in incredibly fashionable and interesting clothing [^1]. The two men have a lunch caravan with huge piles of colourful silk. The men stop and proudly ask if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] would be interested in investing in their futures. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] falls for them and says they would. The men introduce themselves as businessmen for [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]] and begin to describe the concept of silk to them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is quick on the uptake and says they're quite familiar with silk, mostly the fabric made in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The men admit that this silk isn't as nice as their Elvin silk, but it is a lot cheaper than the stuff from the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | Feeling melancholic, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] shared her regret about returning to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], recognizing it as the right choice but lamenting the end of her journey with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] attempted to uplift her spirits by assuring her that they would remain friends and visit her, potentially taking her on smaller adventures. After wiping away a tear, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] shifted the conversation to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s perspective on the journey thus far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | Anxious for answers, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stormed into [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s worship room, practically pulling [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] by the scruff of their neck. Seeing the same orb as before, their voice came out more like a demand than the question they had intended. They requested to know more about what was happening with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and whether it was possible to dispose of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]. The orb considered for a moment before revealing that they were more than happy to share this information, but it would come at a cost. The orb was willing to trade the information [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sought in exchange for their knowledge that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] was the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The orb clarified that this would affect the entire party. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was uncertain if this was a deal they could make on behalf of the whole group and asked if they could wait for the others to return and consult them for their opinions. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] also felt concerned that if they forgot about this, they might not take her back to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | Suddenly, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] begins to cry as he reminisces and mentions the gecko they had met in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Mannnnnn †\|Mannnnnn †]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] quickly figures out that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] is probably putting his grief on the gecko instead of Chenris. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then [Wild Shapes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) into a gecko and keeps crying as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tentatively puts him on their shoulder. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is enamoured by this ability and excitedly asks what else people can do. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] unenthusiastically says they can use magic, while Aidan says he is good at sneaking. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] says that she can also cast magic but not much else. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] interjects, saying that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|obeus]] is much more than a magic caster and is the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. She blushes slightly as she confirms this to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who thinks that's amazing and gives a polite bow that she brushes off.                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | They are all still hesitant and the man sighs saying that they have gotten off on the wrong foot as he uses magic to force them to walk with him to the dining room. Drache isn't affected by the magic due to Korrigan's spell from earlier but joins anyway just in case it can help them get a one-up on the man. They're seated in an elaborate dining room, presumably where Galen would entertain his guests. Skeletons serve them delicious-looking food and nice alcohol. The party are distrustful of the food until Chenris picks up his glass of wine and gives it a taste. It isn't poisoned thankfully and although it was probably the best wine the Dawn good offer it was nowhere near as good as the wine made in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The rest of the party watched in shock at how easily Chenris risked his life to try the wine. With a frown, Chenris states that it isn't poisoned but taste leads much to be desired. The masked man snorts exclaiming if he wanted them dead then he would have done so ages ago. Chenris leans back in his chair comfortably as he sips the wine.                                                                                             |

She admits that she is unsure since nothing like this has ever happened in Ehobel. She is mainly focused on completing their task so they can get away with their lives. As they walked down the path they encountered a small room with animated skeletons roaming around it and a [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Note From Velthis About Reanimated skeletons\|note]] on a nearby table. Chenris used a mage hand to grab it. It read as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | Korrigan pulls out the map and asks where they should be going. Chenris suggest going to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and stopping by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to see what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Korrigan suggests we also go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] since it's on the way to Dawnhaven. Mordecai asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] if she has anywhere she wants to go, but she says she doesn't have anywhere she specifically wants to go, but she should probably return to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] soon, her people probably already think she's dead or kidnapped, although she mentions that she wants to see [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] before going home. Fearing the worst, Mordecai asks how they would pick a new emperor. She explains that one of the lords would be elected into power but that it would take at least 30 years to pick a new ruler, Chenris is surprised, asking, "That quickly?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | While discussing Aidan's fear of the deity, Korrigan mentions Aidan's possession in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. Upon hearing this, the priest perks up and says he knowns all about that incident and therefore knows Aidan very well and applauds him for a job well done. Pissed off, Korrigan asks what he means by that. The priest elaborates and says that Aidan did what his god wanted him to do, which is something to congratulate him on. Korrigan turns on his heels and grabs Aidan to leave, as they are Aidan shouts "WHAT AM I?!". The priest isn't sure but if had to guess he would say "You're [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' - you belong to him". Aidan starts to cry at this revelation and the priest says "i'd be careful around [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]] if i were you". This stops Korrigan in his tracks and asks him what does he mean. The priest elaborates that "Well, you caused one tower to fall, i'm sure he would like to see another fall". korri exclaims "SO WOULD [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|LORWYN]]" and leaves just before the priest calls [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] a feckless bastard. Being dragged out, Aidan's last view of the priest is distorted and his face is replaced by a big black smile of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. |

This room is full of fire brazers, torches and other flame iconography. They find the priest waiting for them and gives them a warm greeting. Mordecai asks if he sees many visitors. He explains that he doesn't get a lot from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] but he does get a handful from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are not Gods and they make mistakes which people wont take kindly to.  Chenris ends up commenting that the method clearly works it just needs to be tweaked to be more…humane. None the less they congratulate Steve on doing a good job with chenris saying they will come back and find away to regulate this operation and maybe invest money into it. He also ask how [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] is doing and Steve says he had disappeared about a week ago ([[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had been gone for 2-3 weeks in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]). as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] leave to investigate he wishes them good luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
