[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] gives him a big hugs and starts to catch him up on what happened in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]. while this is happening, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] decides to write down their [[Other Information/The Party's To-Do List\|priorities]] on a list called "What good in the world can we do" with the top of the list being to help drache break out [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]] tries to make a deal with chenris by saying that he can offer protection for the party, even from the Gods. Chenris raises his doubts about this and ensure him that tricking the mind can do wonders. Their end of the deal is that they have to stay in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]] - forever. Chenris refuses. The man tries to reason that is it not good to give the party everything they have ever wanted? He then goes on to list all of their latent desires one by one:                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] | Once everyone has woken up, Drache and Korrigan explain what happened last night and the group decides it is best to get a move on so they can try and outrun  [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided it was best to take the route that goes through [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]].
