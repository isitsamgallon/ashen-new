| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | According to Steve [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]] was being very racist, like normal, so Steve just killed him and locked the rest of his, now angry, followers in a room with members of other races because steve heard a theory where you can use exposure therapy to help people understand. so he locked them in a room with a goblin, [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], elf and [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. he called "exposure therapy". [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], now concerned about the morals of the situation ask what are all the people doing here and they apart of a new cult now. Steve replies saying probably, no one is here by force in fact a lot f people are going out to other nation to spread the good word. Mordecai looks very afraid at the idea that people are going to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. HIs fears realised when Steve explained that no one had returned for [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] and [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. |
