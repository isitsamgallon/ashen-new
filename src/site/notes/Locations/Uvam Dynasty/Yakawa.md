| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] suddenly awoke from a deep sleep, everything felt incredibly wrong. He quickly checked on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], who seemed fine until he realised she wasn't moving, in fact, nothing around him was moving and it was all dead quiet. He quickly jumped out of bed, grabbing his great axe, he ran outside to find everyone was still around but frozen midway through going about their daily lives. There were even birds hovering motionless in the sky. Drache gripped his GreatAxe tightly before focusing his breath and used [Detect Good and Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good) to see if he could figure out what was happening to him. In this heightened state he realised that this was very similar to the feeling of walking through [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] during their fight with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. With that realisation, he had the sudden and urgent need to leave Uvam. He rushes back inside to write a note to Emmeline: "Something is wrong, I have to leave, be safe my love." He stabs the note into the door before donning his armour and leaving [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] was desperate to leave [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] (and the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]) as soon as possible and urged [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] to pack their belongings quickly so they could leave by the next morning. The morning they set to leave, Mordecai has a quick conversation with Emmeline. They use [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds) to help her healing speed up and say, "Drache is quite possibly one of the last genuinely good men in this world, and if anything were to happen to him, then I have no idea what we could do. Please keep him safe while we're gone"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s purple portal opens just outside of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], and off in the distance they can see [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] drawing in the mud with a stick as he waits for them. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | They discover that the name "Yakawa" refers to a temple at the top of the mountain, there is then a town surrounding it where people and pilgrims live or rest. The town is built on the mountain edge breaking the town into tiers going up the surface of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] with the shrine at the highest point. The town surrounding the shrine is protected by large palisade walls. It is currently late afternoon, so Drache suggests resting up now so they can sneak into [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] in the dead of night and have a better chance of rescuing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. They go to the Adventures Guild where two [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]s are running the reception. Mordecai is unwilling to speak, not wanting to be accidentally noticed by anyone, so Drache is the one to ask for their usual two rooms. But once he is given the rooms, he insists they show him the way - something that is not typically at all, but they relent and awkwardly show them the way. Once shown to their room, Drache suggests having 'an emergency meeting' to discuss their plans. One of the receptionists comments "That's a weird name for a fivesome". Korrigan, forgetting that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was with them, says there are only 4 of them causing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] to become mad at him again. She runs off stating that she'll get her own room. Korrigan tries to apologise but it's a lost cause. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | Aidan had decided to not separate from the group and go to the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to cure his Mummy Rot. Having received his healing he felt more powerful than ever and felt that if he raised his hands at that very moment, then something big would happen. As he did so the world around him slowed to a halt, as a cruel God's laughter could be heard echoing in his head. No matter what he tried, time was stuck in this state of sinful silence. With little else to do, he began to wonder. The once familiar and vibrant world around him was now a shadow of itself, cold and unmoving. Eventually, he found his way to the wear the party had left the horse and carriage and moved them to a safe place in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] then wondered to what he hoped was [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]]. When all was said and done, Aidan had spent nearly a week wondering this wasteland alone desperate to hear anything that wasn't the laughter of his cruel patron. Eventually, he found the fort where he discovered Korrigan stuck motionless on the path. As he looked upon his party member, the world slowly started to spin again as time resumed its march forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | As they're leaving, a large explosion at the camp vibrates across the camp, the shockwave through dust and leaves into the air. In the distance, they hear someone shout "The time is now boys" as they hear the sounds of screams and death. A Tulan soldier rushes up exclaiming "Please can you help, they'll kill me" before getting murdered by another soldier. They find that the once peaceful courtyard is now a battlefield With Olgrik in the middle of it fighting several officers. See his friend victorious, he shouts "Live on stumpy!!!". However, this small moment of distraction is enough for an officer to dig their blade deep into the half-orc's chest, dead on the spot. Drache shed a tier for his best friend but refused to let his sacrifice go to waste, muttering "He knew what he was getting into and died doing what he loved". [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] easily snuck past the rest of the battle and safely escaped from the tunnels. As they arrived in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], they could still see the smoke rising from behind the mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | Annoyed that his authority was being challenged he replied, "No, I'm no longer with them anymore, I'm refusing with my own free will." This revelation shocked them into silence before Korrigan asked if he could at least tell them about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. However, his question is cut short by Xekai his face becomes twisted with rage at the mention of his previous faction's founder. When Korrigan tried to understand the source of the man's anger he simply opened a portal to a place Mordecai and Chenris recognised as the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Simply stating "To save you the travel, now go" Chenris ventured to the portal, thanking him one last time for the help before crossing over. He was soon joined by the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as they stood just outside [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], Drache waiting for them in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are getting ready to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] decides it would be best for him to scout the area out ahead of time and to meet him in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] when they can make it. The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
