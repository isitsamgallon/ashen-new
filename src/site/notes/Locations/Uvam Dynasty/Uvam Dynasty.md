A nation found to the south of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. Its architecture is based on [Edo Period Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period). Uvam is an [Anarchist Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) with many of the towns and people free to do what they want, leading to them being extremely different from one another. Long ago they all banded together under one banner and each contributed forces for a standing army.  [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] spent a long time in the region and has a particularly dark past associated with [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] and its de facto leader, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]].

[[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] share a large bridge that connects them called the [[Locations/Goldpass Bridge\|Goldpass Bridge]] which is used for trade between the two nations. 

### Geography
Uvam is a relatively small nation found towards the south of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]]. The land is known for its vibrant grass, gentle hills and maple trees, a unique feature only found in this nation.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | After some travelling, they made excellent progress until they reached the old wall separating [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]] from the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. The wall was not well-maintained, with much of it severely eroded or completely missing in some areas. Most of the Dawn flags had also been taken down and replaced with the emblem of The [[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood Of The Sun]]. Seeing the symbol reminded [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis Ignithar]] and his promise to teach them magic. They pulled out the magic bell they had given him and rang it. The metal of the bell reshaped into a face and said, "You are currently number 698 in the queue," before switching to [hold music](https://open.spotify.com/track/35oiHtaPcjzqwx2gu9dx6a?si=0bb51f545de94ab3). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they should call back another time, but as they spoke, a distant, hollow toll echoed through the fog-choked air—a deep and resonant bell ringing with sorrow that clung to the bones.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained to the group that they used to work together on the other side of the mountain, close to the board of the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. She must've travelled down to this forest afterwards, which would explain why they hadn't run into each other since they had been down to this region before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] elaborated by saying she moved here when the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]] cut down their tree house, which outrages [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who had wanted to go to one ever since they were little and even offered to help Sylvia get revenge. Before they knew it, they had all decided to go and get revenge, with Sylvia taking it one step further and announcing that they should kill all the fruit Cutter for all the crimes they committed. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] was less enthusiastic about this; however, it was easily convinced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] silently motioned his magic into a healing spirit that washed over [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] with a newfound sense of peace. With a quick gesture, the spirit moved over to [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's father, healing him slightly. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] lamented that even with this matter resolved, neither he nor his mother could ever return home. There was simply too much pain and distrust for him to do so. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's hand now rested on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] 's other shoulder, "You know, [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] may not be your home anymore, but that's okay because home is just a place where you are comfortable. Once upon a time, my home was probably [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and now it's some temple in a mysterious forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] made their way to the border between [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] and the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]], they met a fleet of soldiers guarding the wall. They paused, minds racing on how they were going to get past them again, knowing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s complicated history with them. Chenris' dying words swirled in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s mind as they were finally confronted by their past. How could he save others from their sadness when all he did was run from his own? Impulsively, the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] raised their crimson fingertips to unhook their cloak from over their horns, the sun reflecting off their jewellery like flames coiling through their dark hair. Within seconds, arrows soared through the air. Green vials of sedatives plunged into the necks of our heroes, bringing with them the murky darkness of their consciousness leaving them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | They explained that they were holding a funeral for their friend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]], who had recently been killed by an [[Orcs\|orc]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been everywhere in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], "from [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the [[Locations/The Desert/Broken Ember Throne\|Broken Ember Throne]]," impressing everyone. they then revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been involved in many of the world's recent events, including [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], and even joined the hunt for a missing [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]][^6].  Seeing that it was getting a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] excused themselves, not before promising to get revenge for them if they ever ran into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]] on their travels. Before leaving, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] performed a funeral rite for them and sent the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]]'s soul to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s as he felt that this would be the best place for a person who loves adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Reaching Dawnhaven, he was confronted by the same sight as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] with robbed cultists surrounding the city and thick purple mist blanketing the area. However, the party was nowhere to be seen and time did not unfreeze. Sighing deeply, Aidan followed the path back to the Farpost and to his surprise, he encountered the party travelling along the road, however, time did not unfreeze and the mist carried on past them into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. This left Aidan confused since the last time this happened, time resumed once he rejoined the group, perhaps his objective was different this time? Before he left the party he wrote a quick note: "I'm stuck frozen in time, currently following a black mist going to Farpost and beyond". With that, he carried on into Uvam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] was desperate to leave [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] (and the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]) as soon as possible and urged [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] to pack their belongings quickly so they could leave by the next morning. The morning they set to leave, Mordecai has a quick conversation with Emmeline. They use [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds) to help her healing speed up and say, "Drache is quite possibly one of the last genuinely good men in this world, and if anything were to happen to him, then I have no idea what we could do. Please keep him safe while we're gone"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] suggests finding an Inn or [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] to rest and discuss the rest of their plan. Mordecai then remembers [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|where he is]], and with a nervous look starts to disguise himself so he isn't recognised by the locals. As they are entering the town, they walk past Drache's dirt drawing, it's not very good but Mordecai tries to encourage him by making up artist nonsense. Drache says "I'm glad you can understand it because I definitely can't!" As he starts to laugh heartily. Now with some more time on their hands, Chenris examines Korrigan's wound and explains that the disease is definitely curable and is fine for now, but if left unchecked then he could turn into a zombie. Korrigan admits he has a weird craving for brains, turning to Drache, as his stomach starts to growl. Drache exclaims there isn't much up in his head, but Chenris on the other hand would be a lot tastier. Chenris fearfully grips his head, stating "My cranium will stay firmly uneaten, thank you very much". Mordecai and Drache fashioned a muzzle from some rope and put it on Korrigan as a precaution. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]]          | Annoyed that his authority was being challenged he replied, "No, I'm no longer with them anymore, I'm refusing with my own free will." This revelation shocked them into silence before Korrigan asked if he could at least tell them about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]. However, his question is cut short by Xekai his face becomes twisted with rage at the mention of his previous faction's founder. When Korrigan tried to understand the source of the man's anger he simply opened a portal to a place Mordecai and Chenris recognised as the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Simply stating "To save you the travel, now go" Chenris ventured to the portal, thanking him one last time for the help before crossing over. He was soon joined by the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as they stood just outside [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], Drache waiting for them in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | There are no guards at the walls, so they're able to go straight to the tavern. The door to the tavern is broken and they can hear people inside talking. Mordecai and Korrigan decide to eavesdrop on the convocation. The people are talking about sharpening their weapons and getting ready for something. Mordecai puts his ear to the door and and accidentally falls into the tavern. As soon as this happens, he pretends to be really drunk and one of the men looks at their sword before saying that he'll take them back to their house. Mordecai explains he isn't local and is from [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Carrying on, he explains that he is a person of many homes. The man thinks this means he is homeless. Mordecai denies this and explains that he travels all over and accidentally mentions the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and man seems shocked as they apparently don't see many OFC folk around anymore with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]].                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Mordecai and Chenris decide to see what the priest of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is like. This room is full of fire brazers, torches and other flame iconography. They find the priest waiting for them and gives them a warm greeting. Mordecai asks if he sees many visitors. He explains that he doesn't get a lot from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] but he does get a handful from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]], the islands to the northeast and lot from [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | According to Steve [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]] was being very racist, like normal, so Steve just killed him and locked the rest of his, now angry, followers in a room with members of other races because steve heard a theory where you can use exposure therapy to help people understand. so he locked them in a room with a goblin, [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], elf and [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. he called "exposure therapy". [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], now concerned about the morals of the situation ask what are all the people doing here and they apart of a new cult now. Steve replies saying probably, no one is here by force in fact a lot f people are going out to other nation to spread the good word. Mordecai looks very afraid at the idea that people are going to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. HIs fears realised when Steve explained that no one had returned for [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] and [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
