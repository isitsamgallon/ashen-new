| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] didn't get the chance to ask what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was talking about; they quickly began walking down the path toward Tulan Fort, muttering under their breath about how geologists weren't real scientists. Suddenly, one of them opened their pack, retrieved a map for the Tour Du Ashen, and explained that their next stop was likely Tulan Fort unless they wanted to return to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]] to check out the goblins outside of it. They decided to continue to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] and possibly check out Tulan along the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]] | Once they had gathered their things, they moved on. Heading outside, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] realised they were only about an hour's walk from [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]]. The road was straightforward from then on, reaching [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]], the next stop on the Tour Du Ashen. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] reminded them that afterwards, they should stop in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] to investigate those dissaprences. They walked silently, with none quite knowing what to say. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] eventually broke the silence by asking if everyone was okay, as they were chained upside down in that dungeon. Everyone reported being okay, as many had experienced worse on their adventures. Kerrigan had slight burns where the iron touched their skin, but he was also fine. |
