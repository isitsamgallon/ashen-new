A Small town close to the boarder of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] that doesn't look very well put together. many people are still drunk or lying in their own vomit. Many people are in skimpy outfits trying to attract people into clubs. 

It is a very rough place to live as many people are in some sort of slave contract with the local pimp [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]]. being forced to steal from and/ or kidnap for him to presumable work off some kind of debt. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] used to live here when he worked in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] before later escaping.
