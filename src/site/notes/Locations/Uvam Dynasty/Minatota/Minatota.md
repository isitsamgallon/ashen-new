### Overview
A Small town close to the boarder of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] that doesn't look very well put together. many people are still drunk or lying in their own vomit. Many people are in skimpy outfits trying to attract people into clubs. 

It is a very rough place to live as many people are in some sort of slave contract with the local pimp [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]]. being forced to steal from and/ or kidnap for him to presumable work off some kind of debt. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] used to live here when he worked in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] before later escaping.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | Aidan nods, signaling understanding, which prompts [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to directly question Aidan’s tendency towards silence. Aidan reveals that they have always been reticent, finding their adventures overwhelming, and using silence as a means of processing their experiences. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] empathises, noting the diversity within [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] can lead to significant interpersonal conflict. Aidan acknowledges this observation after a brief pause, leading [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to discuss various disputes encountered throughout their journey, including the incident where Aidan killed a [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]][^4]. Aidan’s reaction is one of shock and confusion as they question how [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is aware of that event, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admits to having no knowledge of its implications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | Once [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is rested Korrigan spends some time learning and casting [Lesser Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration ) so he can cure his hand of the zombie virus. He watches as disgusting black ooze leaks out of his hand. The streets were incredibly quiet, unlike their experience of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] as Drache led the way to the secret tunnel. They walked along the path as took them further and further up the mountainside. Soon they came to a dilapidated small house, that looked like no one had touched it, let alone lived in it, for centuries. Having walked the path many times, Drache enters the house with no hesitation and goes into the living room/ kitchen. He makes a B-line for the cupboard on the back wall and opens the doors. With a practised hand, he finds the hidden switch and opens the false back revealing a dark stone tunnel that seems to have been cut off the mountain long ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | They enter the tower and are greeted by the usual priests in white robes. The receptionist asks if there is anything they can do to help. Mordecai explains how they want to sleep in the tower since the gods can't interact with them here. Korrigan also mentions how they will also carry out an audit on the tower. The receptionist asks who has problems with the Gods. They all point to each other singingly out Chenris, Aidan and Mordecai. The receptionist says they are more than welcome to stay as long as the problem people wear iron-clad cuffs with needles in them to stop their use of magic. Chenris and Aidan refuse to wear the cuffs. Aidan says that if he wears the cuffs then it will bring up a similar level of trauma that made him kill the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]]. Making the receptionist and the Mordecai quite unnerved and angry. Korrigan is allowed in to complete his "audit"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | According to Steve [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]] was being very racist, like normal, so Steve just killed him and locked the rest of his, now angry, followers in a room with members of other races because steve heard a theory where you can use exposure therapy to help people understand. so he locked them in a room with a goblin, [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], elf and [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. he called "exposure therapy". [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], now concerned about the morals of the situation ask what are all the people doing here and they apart of a new cult now. Steve replies saying probably, no one is here by force in fact a lot f people are going out to other nation to spread the good word. Mordecai looks very afraid at the idea that people are going to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. HIs fears realised when Steve explained that no one had returned for [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] and [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Aidan explained that he doesn’t know how to function outside of being a weapon to be pointed at others and explained how he was sorry since being locked up in that sell took him back to his childhood which is a very traumatic time for him. Mordecai ends up telling him that he needs to get his shit together and stop trying to push away from the group as they are there to help them and they hug it out. Korrigan misty step into a the room to give him a hug as drache and chenris run off. Aidan cry’s himself to sleep. |
