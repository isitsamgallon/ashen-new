A place in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] was seen last. The bar is hidden within a book shop. If you nod at the old shop owner, she will pull a book on a shelf to reveal a secret door. 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] used to work here
