| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]          | Chenris and Mordecai became spell casters in very different ways. Chenris learnt through studying and researching magic, whereas Mordecai was born with it. Because of this, Mordecai could not control his powers until he had practised a lot. But before that, he was a child with no control, and when he was first tapped into his magic, he accidentally cast a fireball in his family home - a very wooden house. Mordecai could escape the fire without much harm, but his family and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]] weren't so lucky. Without a family or a roof over their head, Mordecai wandered the lands of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] before meeting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] at the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]]. Over time, he learn to control his powers but hid them as best he could so he couldn't hurt anyone again. |
