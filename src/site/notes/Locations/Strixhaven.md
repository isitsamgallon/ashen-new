### Overview
Strixhaven is the most prestigious magic academy in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It is both a city and university and fazes in and out of the material plane, reappearing in different locations depending on the academy's needs and interests. Their logo has an emblem of a bird on it, holding a banner. 

### Description
University stood as a breathtaking testament to the convergence of magic and knowledge, its five floating islands suspended in the sky by massive, pulsating blue rocks that thrummed with raw arcane energy. Each island bore a towering structure adorned with a glowing magical symbol—representing the schools of magic taught within—and was tethered to the central island by colossal, ancient chains that shimmered with enchantments. At the heart of it all loomed the central campus, a sprawling, 4,000-year-old edifice of stone and crystal, its spires reaching toward the heavens and its walls glowing faintly with the accumulated power of millennia. The air around the university crackled with magic, so thick it felt alive, as if every breath drew in the essence of creation itself. Beyond the campus, a vibrant residential district stretched outward, a harmonious tapestry of every race imaginable—[[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]], orcs, humans, dragons, and more—living side by side, their lives intertwined with the magic that flowed from the university like a river of light and possibility.

### History & Other Information
- Sometime after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] the university was researching [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] and initiated a research study that involved students being turned into pure magic and sent to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to mine crystals, inadvertently creating [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]..

### Known Previous Locations
- Very close to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]].
- East of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]]

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 42\|Session 42]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s demeanour immediately shifted from astonishment to blind rage and fury. He did not need his  Primal Savagery ability to draw blood from his hands. His rage was enough. They hadn't seen this rage since [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] temporarily received all his memories back during their last visit to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] [^1].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | Examining the arrow, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] couldn't identify the poison but noticed that the name "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Dave McDuffin †\|Dave McDuffin †]]" was engraved on the shaft. Sensing some magic on the arrow, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over the analysis. However, they could only determine that it was enchanted. CXhenris, on the other hand, immediately recognised it from an old class at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] as a "Name Poison," a technique from [[Locations/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] that creates especially deadly poisons targeted at a specific person. The arrow would not affect anyone else and could not be replicated. Chenris shared this knowledge with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who explained it to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], much to their surprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ignored her alarming comments and instead focused on telling her all about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and how they were sealed away and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] were hurting them. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that one of his goals in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was to destroy the tower. Sylvia initially didn't believe him until he showed her the book he stole from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], which explained everything to her. After reading the book, she was immediately on board and wanted to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | The dragon was less than impressed and, after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested to try [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]'s lost property office, left them to their business. Meanwhile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] what Make-A-Wish was. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained that it was a scheme that helped young people who were dying achieve their wishes, like meeting a celebrity or something similar. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s face dropped as they exclaimed, "I HAVE CANCER?!?" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to explain that this wasn't the case, but none of them were convinced. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], for their part, got out a notebook and started writing out their bucket list, which was:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | Returning to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained everything to them, and with little else they could do, they decided to head for [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and see if they could find her along the way. They finally left [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] and had an extremely good time. Along the way, they heard some strange singing; [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] sent [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bobs\|Bobs]] to investigate and learnt that it seemed like people were dancing around a fire. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] sarcastically asked if they should say hi, to which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sarcastically replied that they should. Missing the sarcasm, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says "OK!" before running over to say hi before the others could stop them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]              | Soon a large golden portal opened and as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] stepped through, they all returned to their normal forms and regained their powers. Outside, they found themselves in a [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] courtyard. Stepping out of the portal [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] soon realised that he had no recollection of what happened after the headmaster's spell was cast leaving [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to wonder if they should tell him what happened as in this situation it seems like ignorance is bliss as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was incredibly angry and sad with all of his memories returned. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was not aware of [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s thought process and told him generally what happened before something clicked and they fell quite [^4].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]              | Without hesitation, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] put 10 [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] on the table. the clerk smiled and said it would be sent soon. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked how they knew where it needed to as [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had only written "To [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]" on the outside. The clerk said it was magic, and it would know who to send to. With that done [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] led to a small tavern in the residential area of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Along the way, with a sly smile, Mordecai suggested they do shot again, and they were thinking absinthe would be perfect. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was hesitant to agree after how bad their hangover was the last time they drank absinthe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]              | As the night went on, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had even more to drink until they passed out. They awoke in a the Legally distinct Quidditch fields of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Mordecai was the first to wake up, and as their hangover wasn't so bad, they decided to have a look around to see if anything interesting was around. the field was littered with unconscious [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] students , including the dragon that runs the cafe. Surprisingly, the dragon was actually wearing the necklace that Mordecai traded some months ago to cover the cost of Drache's coffee he accidentally ordered[^6].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | With their note written and left with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]][^1], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] headed out with their destination set for [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had marked the general area of the university but soon found that knowing the exact location wasn't necessary, as when they approached the area, Mordecai and Halfbie would feel the magic emanating off of the university miles away. Putting away the map, they followed the magic that filled the area around them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | They soon crossed the board being greeted by the familiar but still awe inspiring site of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] University stood as a breathtaking testament to the convergence of magic and knowledge, its five floating islands suspended in the sky by massive, pulsating blue rocks that thrummed with raw arcane energy. Each island bore a towering structure adorned with a glowing magical symbol—representing the schools of magic taught within—and was tethered to the central island by colossal, ancient chains that shimmered with enchantments. At the heart of it all loomed the central campus, a sprawling, 4,000-year-old edifice of stone and crystal, its spires reaching toward the heavens and its walls glowing faintly with the accumulated power of millennia. The air around the university crackled with magic, so thick it felt alive as if every breath drew in the essence of creation itself. Beyond the campus, a vibrant residential district stretched outward, a harmonious tapestry of every race imaginable—[[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]], orcs, [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]], [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], and more—living side by side, their lives intertwined with the magic that flowed from the university like a river of light and possibility. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | After some talking, it was revealed that the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] used to do a lot of research on [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]], specifically [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] before they were kicked out of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] for causing too much hassle for the guards and priests. Most of their research had been taken or was locked away by the university, so the engineers couldn't be of much help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then asked if it was possible to see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]], the headmaster, reasoning that he must know something about this research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The headmaster went silent for a moment before revealing that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] used to be a lecturer at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] before being thrown out for being a shapeshifter and his fanatical worship of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] (Sacrificing students). The headteacher explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] was trying to make his own [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army with all the sacrifices he was making. However, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] refused to elaborate beyond this. instead, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] asked about the crystals and making more towers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The headmaster revealed that making more towers was possible but would involve getting crystals. The only way to do this was to convert people into purely magical energy and send them to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to get crystals. However, the journey was one way as the people would often die or would slowly be turned mad. With sadness, the headmaster revealed that they lost a lot of very talented pupils doing this, which is why it is forbidden. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then went uncharacteristically serious and asked if, before this, there had been any known sightings of a beast known as the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. The headmaster said yes and explained that the primary theory was that anyone who died in [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] was turned into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]]. After a short pause, they asked if someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] studied at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

On the walls that hadn't burnt down, the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo could be seen, immediately raising suspicions of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. While investigating, Aidan is able to confirm that the ship is not the same one from earlier in their adventure. Upon seeing the dead bodies, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] goes incredibly quiet as he tries to hold back his panic. They all begin to edge close ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] less so) to try and learn more from the wreckage. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] takes this time to analyse the magic around the ship and learns that there are faint traces of strange magical energy, information [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] instantly links to the large wave of magic that spread out from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] 's work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also realises that that crystal absolutely shouldn't have shattered since they're quite durable and important to keeping the airship in the air.

Chenris says, as everyone knows, he went to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] as a child. In his Magic Theory class, he met the late [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]], who became almost a father figure to Chenris - especially since his relationship with his father was…strained. Chenris and Leotoris would spend a lot of time together researching theories after class and significantly increased the world's understanding of magic theory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Having never really been out of the confines of the city, Chenris begged to go on the trip. Leotoris finally relented and snuck his name on the list. Unfortunately, because Chenris was inexperienced with dungeons, he accidentally triggered a trap, but at least in the second, Leotoris jumped in, saved him, and died in his place. With his dying breath, he passed him [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]] and said, "Learn all the secrets of this world and solve this problem, if it's the last thing you do."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Chenris would often stay with Leotoris after class to work on experiments leading to chenris seeing him as a father figure since his actual dad wasn't the kindest. However, when on a field trip in ancient ruin chenris accidentally set of trap that got the professor killed and with his final words he gave Chenris a note with a problem they were never able to solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So when it came to completing the [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]], Chenris froze and he cant quite understand why his body wont let let go a note he's already memorised and poured over for years.

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The journey to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] began with trepidation and wonder as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ascended a winding stone staircase carved into the side of a steep cliff. The stairs extended upwards, seemingly into the void, with no visible destination in sight. The researchers accompanying them climbed without hesitation, their confidence reassuring yet unsettling in the surreal landscape. When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] reached the top, the world below vanished as if consumed by a misty veil, and before them emerged [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], the legendary floating city. Suspended on colossal glowing rocks, the city’s architecture seemed to defy gravity itself, an ethereal marvel held aloft by ancient magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The city stretched out in all directions, its towers and spires piercing the sky like crystalline needles. Bridges of enchanted crystal connected the floating islands, each step illuminating the paths with faint pulses of energy. The faint hum of arcane power filled the air, accompanied by the soothing sounds of fountains and cascading waterfalls. The main island at the heart of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] was dominated by a grand hall with gilded rooftops that glistened in the sunlight. The emblem of the academy, a bird with wings spread wide, perched atop its highest spire, a symbol of knowledge soaring above the mundane world. Surrounding this central hub, islands dedicated to each school of magic floated in a loose circle, each a microcosm of its discipline. The gardens of Transmutation were lush and alive, their vibrant flora shifting hues in a mesmerising display. Illusion’s domain shimmered like a mirage, its buildings reflecting light in ways that made their boundaries seem uncertain, while Necromancy’s grounds brooded in muted shadows, their spectral energy palpable even from afar.                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] traversed the shimmering crystal bridges, their footsteps resonated with subtle vibrations, as though the city itself acknowledged their presence. The streets bustled with students and scholars, robed in an array of vibrant colours representing their fields of study. Conversations floated on the air, ranging from debates on magical theory to hushed whispers about the complexities of spells. The sheer magnitude of knowledge housed in [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] was both awe-inspiring and humbling and for a moment, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] could almost forget the weight of their mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The hub was a grand hall filled with travellers and bustling attendants. A blue-scaled kobold manned the reception desk, efficiently arranging their passage and handing them a slip with their room number and departure time. With an hour to spare, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] dispersed to explore. Korrigan, drawn to a coffee shop run by a golden-scaled dragon, convinced Mordecai to join him for tea. However, the cost of their drinks—fifty [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] —left Korrigan floundering. Mordecai, with a resigned sigh, unclasped his golden chain and offered it as payment. The gesture went unacknowledged as Korrigan accepted his tea in silence, a heavy mix of gratitude and guilt weighing on him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The room’s intricate archway shimmered like a pool of water, beckoning them to step through. As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] prepared to leave [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] behind, they couldn’t shake the feeling that the academy had left its mark on them. The knowledge gained and sacrifices made in this city of magic would shape the choices and challenges that lay ahead, their journey only just beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Inside the mansion, they encountered a spectral old man clutching a page and an infant’s decayed body. Using illusions, Mordecai tricked him into relinquishing the page, but the man’s anguish summoned [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]]. The battle was brutal; [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]]’s incorporeal form resisted their attacks, and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] fell to its tendrils, his screams echoing through the cursed halls. Drache and Chenris managed to retrieve the page, while Kal’s near-death forced Aiden to act swiftly, saving his life. The group escaped through a flaming breach, leaving the mansion to burn as [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] mages arrived to extinguish the blaze. Their silent judgement weighed heavily on Chenris, a haunting reminder of his past. Weary but resolute, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] moved forward, knowing their perilous quest to banish [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]] was far from over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
