### Overview
Strixhaven is the most prestigious magic academy in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It is both a city and university and fazes in and out of the material plane, reappearing in different locations depending on the academy's needs and interests. Their logo has an emblem of a bird on it, holding a banner. 

### Description
University stood as a breathtaking testament to the convergence of magic and knowledge, its five floating islands suspended in the sky by massive, pulsating blue rocks that thrummed with raw arcane energy. Each island bore a towering structure adorned with a glowing magical symbol—representing the schools of magic taught within—and was tethered to the central island by colossal, ancient chains that shimmered with enchantments. At the heart of it all loomed the central campus, a sprawling, 4,000-year-old edifice of stone and crystal, its spires reaching toward the heavens and its walls glowing faintly with the accumulated power of millennia. The air around the university crackled with magic, so thick it felt alive, as if every breath drew in the essence of creation itself. Beyond the campus, a vibrant residential district stretched outward, a harmonious tapestry of every race imaginable—elves, orcs, humans, dragons, and more—living side by side, their lives intertwined with the magic that flowed from the university like a river of light and possibility.

### History & Other Information
