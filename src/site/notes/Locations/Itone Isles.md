### Overview
A snowy nation found to the north of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. The island where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]], lives. It is described like the following: "Isolated and inhospitable, [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] is but a graveyard of a forgotten civilisation, a silent testament to an era lost in the mists of time."

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first travelled here in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]].

### Geography
The island is surrounded by water on all sides and is made up of snowy cliffs and dense fog. Notably, all of the wildlife and nature seem to have died long ago. Everything is covered in this thick layer of snow, however, looking under the snow will reveal thousands of human bones

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | When asked about her journey, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] expressed wonder and gratitude, highlighting how meaningful and enriching the trip had been. She noted her ability to learn new things and discover genuine friendships during her travels. When questioned about her favorite place, she mentioned being struck by the mystery and history of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]], as well as the profound experience of witnessing the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|city]]'s disappearance. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admitted to feeling jealousy over not having witnessed this astonishing sight, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] quickly tempered his excitement by pointing out the grave implications of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]'s vanishing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | They all wake up on the beaches of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] a few days later when the captain and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] travel up the mountain to find them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] doesn't hear anything from them. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] all decided it would be best to go back up their mountain and check [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body and cave to see if they could find or learn anything about what happened or what might happen now that Ebis has the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. Travelling up the mountain again, they find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body fully decomposed and the one made out of solid [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]]. Concerned about the abnormality of the body decomposition rate and the [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] skeleton, they decided to investigate. Mordecai suddenly remembers that they used [Speak With Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead)  from a wild magic surge from a fight a while back. They use it to learn more while Aidan figures out how to return the body to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to add to the nation's funds. The spell gave them five questions to ask the dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]] | When weighing up their options, Mordecai says, that whatever they do he can stay with Aidan and cast [Dispel Magic]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) If and when needed. Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | When heading back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] tried to plan what to do next, but the decision eventually broke down as neither [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nor [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] could decide as they kept thinking about how Chenris would have loved to go to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and if he couldn't go then what was the point? Eventually, they decided to go to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] since that's where all clues were leading, so they felt obligated to go. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to cut the tension by saying, "If it helps, I would also find [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] fascinating", with a smile, it was not well received, with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] even mocking them. Still feeling quite hot-headed, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] snarkily asked what they could even do. Not to be deterred, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly explains that they love magic, researching and tinkering with things. Upon hearing these, they begrudgingly invite [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] to join them until they can figure out what is going on. Before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] could accept, they heard a voice speak in their head, telling them to join the group. They immediately start looking around to try and find the source of the voice but failed to do so, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] makes a comment on how they look like they're on drugs. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Arriving at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], they are confronted with a small fishing village comprised mostly of hearty sailors, and the stench of fresh fish clouds the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] approaches. The person they deem to have the best vibe and strikes up a conversation. It's an incredibly gruff sailor who greets them well enough. Getting straight to the point, they ask if the sailor could take them to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]], he says he can, but it would cost them. The sailor says that it's a long journey, plus they would need a return trip, and he would need to get supplies. All in, it would cost them 1000 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to haggle the price when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] stepped up and offered to pay the fee, handing over 100 Platinum to the sailor. She explained that she was feeling quite bad for not helping out as much, and it was the least she could do for the people who have been so good to her. They all thank her, and the sailor points to his boat, a smaller wooden ship that doesn't even have an inside or lower deck, but there was enough space for some bed rolls and to eat.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Sailing further, the fog began to get thicker and thicker until they weren't able to see their hand outstretched from their body. After another few minutes of travel, they finally made land at [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly gets off the ship and exclaims that it is good to make land again. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is less than impressed and quite jealous of the fact that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was also able to cast fireball and even fly and was quite mean with the Eldarin, going as far as calling them 'Halfwit'. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] helps the sailor fix his boat while [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] attempts to teach [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] how to speak whale. Warning the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] that the sound for 'Hallo' is very similar to 'Fuck ya mum', and said to not mix it up. Venturing further inland, the island is covered in dense fog and a thick layer of snow. All of the plant life was long dead, and disturbingly, when walking on the snow, it wasn't always the familiar sound of snow crunching but the sounds of snapping bones. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] wiped away some of the snow to find the ground was covered in thousands of [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] bones. He quickly covered the bones back up before catching up with the rest.                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | They decided to push on. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] immediately started to try and climb the cliff face, but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] suggested that there would probably be a path up the mountain if they walked around. Walking around the mountain they find a large stone archway with runes written on it and a path going up the mountain, although it was quite steep and windy. Investigating the runes carefully [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] discovered they were Ancient Draconic and translated them to say "The resting place of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]], may this fortress stand strong"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | Korrigan pulls out the map and asks where they should be going. Chenris suggest going to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and stopping by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to see what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Korrigan suggests we also go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] since it's on the way to Dawnhaven. Mordecai asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] if she has anywhere she wants to go, but she says she doesn't have anywhere she specifically wants to go, but she should probably return to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] soon, her people probably already think she's dead or kidnapped, although she mentions that she wants to see [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] before going home. Fearing the worst, Mordecai asks how they would pick a new emperor. She explains that one of the lords would be elected into power but that it would take at least 30 years to pick a new ruler, Chenris is surprised, asking, "That quickly?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Chenris says they should go to the Library and learn about the Dwarves in the library and then send ofd the quest to recover the cities riches. While they're at it, they should also exonerate Horrigan. Going to the library, Korrigan tries to find any information on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] but cant find anything. Chenris, having better luck finds a book detailing the history of the Dwarves called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy\|The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy]]. Before they leave Chenris wants to go to the deans office to try and learn anything abouit [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]]'s whereabouts. He finds a lot of notes on what he was researching but most of seems to be the scribbles of a madman, however one of the notes says "[[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]" there's another that mentions the locations [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]]. Finally, there are a few mentions of a place called "[[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]]" a place on another continent to the one where the campaign is set.
