| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | Everyone woke up in their camp spot outside [[Locations/OFC/The Inchling Kingdom\|The Inchling Kingdom]]. Not wanting to be rude, they all decided to leave a note for the [[Other Information/Races/Inchlings\|Inchlings]], saying goodbye and thanking them for the food. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] ended up writing the note by casting Enlarge/Reduce on themselves so they could make the thing a bit smaller than they usually would, looking for a quill, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] incised that Mordecai used their, summoning an ancient-looking quill from nothingness "It's special - no ink needed!" they said excitedly with beaming smile on their face. |
