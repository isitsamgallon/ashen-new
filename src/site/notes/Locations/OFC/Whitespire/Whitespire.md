### Overview
Whitespire is a town right near the board of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and has one of [[The 5 Towers\|The 5 Towers]] that hold up the heavens and stop the Gods from being able to directly interact with the material plane. The whole town is made from white marble, hence the name, with everyone generally being friendly. The town was quite badly damaged during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]] and is currently considered quite dangerous due to the large [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] found close to the town borders.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]     | Soon after returning, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] set off for [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decided it would be best to find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Shoni Anofora\|Shoni Anofora]], rather than risk needing help from [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] again. He quickly discovered a tavern down the road where the bartender, a dwarf, was speaking simply while pouring drinks for various customers. When Aiden asked about Shoni, the bartender replied, “I’m no good at remembering. Do you have something to jog my memory?” Reluctantly, Aiden pushed a few extra coins across the counter, and the bartender began to speak more formally. He explained that he had heard of Shoni and that she was last known to be heading south. With another payment, he detailed that she was working in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the Desert]], beyond [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]]. Aiden thanked him for the information and returned to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], who refused to believe him, citing the bartender's poor command of Common.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]     | This time, he found himself in a house he was all too familiar with. The smell of pancakes enveloped him as he followed it to the kitchen of his family home in [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. There, he discovered his parents cooking and his sister, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Freya\|Freya]], sitting at the table, waiting for breakfast. After they finished eating, his parents were much nicer than the ones he knew. His father then asked if he could go to the shop and pick up a few things. He nodded meekly before rushing off to the nearby [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. Inside, he found the items his father wanted, and while paying, he noticed a newspaper detailing the story of a group called [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Fatebreakers]]. They had died in an attack by the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]], which had caused a large forest fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | It is late afternoon when they arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] is nervous about being around the area with Aidan's possession and their last interaction with [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]' staff [^2]. They all decide to walk around the town and make camp in the forest nearby. Still mentally exhausted, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says it might not be worth it to use their Tiny Hut spell and have a night watch like normal. They all agree. while figuring out watch partners, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is insistent that he watches with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], who happily accepts. With everyone asleep, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] is eager to carry on their training, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] refuses, stating that he has a few things he wants to talk about. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] expresses that he feels incredibly lost at the moment; their adventures feel incredibly chaotic, and they're finding themselves incredibly lost with what is happening. At the start, this was fine as it meant he could focus on the fighting and defending, but not it becoming too much. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is also feeling very guilty about the death of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] | While discussing Aidan's fear of the deity, Korrigan mentions Aidan's possession in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. Upon hearing this, the priest perks up and says he knowns all about that incident and therefore knows Aidan very well and applauds him for a job well done. Pissed off, Korrigan asks what he means by that. The priest elaborates and says that Aidan did what his god wanted him to do, which is something to congratulate him on. Korrigan turns on his heels and grabs Aidan to leave, as they are Aidan shouts "WHAT AM I?!". The priest isn't sure but if had to guess he would say "You're [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' - you belong to him". Aidan starts to cry at this revelation and the priest says "i'd be careful around [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]] if i were you". This stops Korrigan in his tracks and asks him what does he mean. The priest elaborates that "Well, you caused one tower to fall, i'm sure he would like to see another fall". korri exclaims "SO WOULD [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|LORWYN]]" and leaves just before the priest calls [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] a feckless bastard. Being dragged out, Aidan's last view of the priest is distorted and his face is replaced by a big black smile of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are getting ready to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] decides it would be best for him to scout the area out ahead of time and to meet him in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] when they can make it. The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | As they're leaving the town, Mordecai questions whether they can deal with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Chenris notes it would be best to wait to be with Drache again before attempting such a challenge. They all double down on their aim to investigate the Pyramid]]. Along the way Chenris spots a black bear and its cub and notifies the party, reminding everyone how dangerous bears are when it comes to their cubs. Korrigan casts [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship) but gets countered and he thinks the bear is ok and doesn't mean any harm and in fact, he should go pet them. Mordecai and chenris rebuke him. They manage to convince him not to go pet the bear and Mordecai [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|minor illusion]] to make them look way bigger. The bear runs away in fear. They carry on and arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. As they are deciding on what to do in the town, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] reveals that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] had contacted him the day before to make a deal, however, he refused. They all hope this didn't piss off God.                                                                                                                                                 |
