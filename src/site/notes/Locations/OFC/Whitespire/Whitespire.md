Whitespire is a town right near the board of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and has one of [[The 5 Towers\|The 5 Towers]] that hold up the heavens and stop the Gods from being able to directly interact with the material plane. The whole town is made from white marble, hence the name, with everyone generally being friendly. The town was quite badly damaged during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]] and is currently considered quite dangerous due to the large [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] found close to the town borders.
