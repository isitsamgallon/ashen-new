A mysterious dungeon spawned in during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]] when [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] used one of his Bags of beans to disrupt a canon, doing major damage to their forces. It is considered a major problem since it blocks the majority of trade due to it appearing right in the middle of the main path into the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] started clearing it in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] and defeated the Mummy Lord in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]], allowing for the pyramid to disappear and for better travel and trade to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].

The pyramid is filled with long, dark corridors and large rooms with Sarcophagi and [Mummies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16961-mummy) guarding different sections of the structure. Many areas are filled with puzzles that are required to progress further into the structure. All of the walls are lined with [[Gold\|Gold]] with a lot of [[Gold\|Gold]] found all over, most commonly in the Sarcophagi. 

In one of the first rooms, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] find an ancient skeleton with a book called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|Poems from the Sand Dunes]], which gives clues on solving the various puzzles found in the dungeon.
