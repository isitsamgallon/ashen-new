| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]]          | They cross the portal to find themselves on a road they recognise to be near [[Locations/OFC/Foxtail Orchards\|Foxtail Orchards]] with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] waiting for them. Shocked to see the ever-mysterious cloaked figure, Mordecai asked what happened and why he was there. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] explained that when the door closed on her she went looking for help and found Xekai who offered to help them. Xekai spoke up, looking disgusted at how damaged and bloody they all were after the fight and opened a portal. A halfling woman soon walked through and asked if he wanted the usual, Xekai nodded and she fully healed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. They were now filled with questions that seemed to flow from their mouths like a vast waterfall, however, Xekai refused to answer any of them. Instead opting to say "At least you cleared that pyramid, a little behind schedule perhaps, but a good job nonetheless". Korrigan's questions about this schedule were only met with Xekai's refusal to answer. Korrigan then realises that Xekai was the one who killed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]], otherwise known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]]' father. He tries to quietly point this out to Mordecai but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhears him and bursts into tears. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] soon arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Foxtail Orchards\|Foxtail Orchards]], they're very tense as they remember the contract they signed with the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] during the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|war]] meant that this town was their official territory. Korrigan manages to get a small look inside and everything seems calm. There aren't that many people on the streets, notably less than when they were last there. They decide to go in and have a look, there are no guards so getting to the tavern is pretty easy. Looking inside they see the Halfling barkeep still behind the bar doing their normal work and no one else around them. Chenris and Korrigan enter, and the barkeep welcomes them in. Mordecai asks how things are going. She notes that not many people walk through Foxtail anymore with the Pyramid]] blocking a lot of the trade and the goblins being murdered. According to her, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] came into town during the war and killed most of the goblins on their way to fight. The party promises to help the best they can and move on.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Similar bills are found in all of the offices. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]'s office was the last to be found.
