### Overview
Silkhorn is a small fishing village found to the west of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] that has been left in a terrible state after the [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]].

### Notable Information  
- The Party wasn't welcome in the village after committing several acts of mild disrespect such as trespassing in the goblin's bar, destroying their quest board and general tomfoolery. As the leaders of the OFC, they are now allowed back in the village. 
- Sometime before [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], Azel arrived in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] and began to stoke up racial hate, blaming the town's misfortunes on other races. He managed to stoke up so much hatred that they hung many Goblins ([[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] or not) and many of the foreigners. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]] tried his best to contain the hate but this only stoked the flames of hatred and caused riots. He was later killed by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]], who then formed [[Groups & Factions/The Hero Cult\|The Hero Cult]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]     | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s purple portal opens just outside of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], and off in the distance they can see [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] drawing in the mud with a stick as he waits for them. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]     | After the events of the last [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|session]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are approaching the docks of [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] to find [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] waiting for them, somehow making it there before them. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] gives him a big hugs and starts to catch him up on what happened in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]. while this is happening, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] decides to write down their [[Other Information/The Party's To-Do List\|priorities]] on a list called "What good in the world can we do" with the top of the list being to help drache break out [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]]     | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] regroups with drache and Korrigan, chenris finding out that the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] have put out a hit on [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] because the goblins blame the group for their invasion of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] not going very well. They leave for [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] as soon as possible and make the illegal crossing route legal so its ok. There's now a small cult that's popped up in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] lead by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]. He has capitalised on the hatred of the other races and used that to gather people to follow him. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] infiltrate his church where they find out he has been kind with people and offered them food while preaching about hatred, which is how he has gathered so many followers. This makes [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] very concerned and they send a messenger to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] to investigate into the cult in their absence. They find the person who crosses the water and get in the boat and head for [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Despite their victory, the cult leader escapes, leaving [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] frustrated and on edge. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]], taking charge, offers to escort them to [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] for rest and recovery, noting the cult’s heinous deeds and his regiment’s efforts in dismantling their operations. The group, with no memory of how they ended up in the cult’s clutches, reluctantly agrees. As they march toward [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], Bridges repeatedly asserts his name and authority, leaving the group to ponder the mysteries surrounding their capture and the challenges still to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | The journey to [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]], offered the group a chance to reflect on their escape and bond amid the tense atmosphere. The quiet forest trail, marked by dappled sunlight and the faint scent of the sea, provided a deceptive calm. As Bridges shared the region's history, the group learned of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]] and its unique credit-based economy, posing a challenge to their reliance on [[gold\|gold]]. Entering the weathered port town, the adventurers found its resilience remarkable despite its scorched buildings and wary inhabitants. At the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]], they secured membership and lodging while navigating strict regulations, including a law against unlicensed magic. Chenris complied, purchasing a licence, but Mordecai defiantly refused, setting the stage for future complications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Trivia:
- The arm of a seemingly noble man with a significant credit count was left just outside the walls before [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] left.
