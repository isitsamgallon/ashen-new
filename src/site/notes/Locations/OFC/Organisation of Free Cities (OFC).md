### Overview
The OFC is a small nation found  west of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. Sometime after the events of [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]], the [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] occurred causing the people of the land to fracture from The Dawn and form The OFC after the former refused to defend them against the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]]. It is assumed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] also defected from The Dawn around this time but it is unclear exactly when or why this happened. Upon his defection, he became the leader of the armies and was known throughout the OFC as a powerful figure and a beacon of hope to its people.

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] disdains the OFC and everything that it stands for and wished to take back the land and its people under his rule. In [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] learnt that at least part of his reasoning for wanting the land back was due to its strategic position when at war with [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and its great trade routes via the seas. He went so far as to start [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|a full-scale war]] with the OFC to try and gain the land but was defeated.

### Geography 
The OFC is mostly made up of dense forests and tall spruce trees. The nation is slightly bigger than the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] and is surrounded by water on all sides but one which borders with The Dawn. 

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] made great use of the OFC's geography during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They used the dense woods for ambushes. Due It is surrounded by water on most sides and there only being one entrance by land, they used that entrance as a natural choke point to control their enemy's movements.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] began speaking but was quickly interrupted; the prince was more interested in hearing from the handsome [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] than the unattractive leaders of the Organisation of Free Cities ([[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]). [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suppressed his frustration and let [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] take the lead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | Fire licked at the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] 's feet as they regained consciousness, bound tightly to a cross surrounded by all the people he had run from for years. His friends dangled upside down around them, bound and gagged, watching the events unfold - unable to help. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't recognise laughs bitterly in the face of their Father, brother and previous employer. "You know this won't work." They chided as they gestured their bound hands towards the fire snaking around their ankles. Arwen simply did not care as he watched the leaders of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] dangle at his mercy. He informed [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] that the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|goblin mafia]] would take over their precious [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] when they died by his hand. His eyes dragged themself over his previous employee, the object of his obsession and then vehement hatred, restrained in front of him. "One thing I have found after years of trying to find you, that little taste of catching you and you evading my grip once again, I no longer care about you." Those words hung like a man at the gallows as the slimy nightclub owner retreated, leaving the Thornewood family reunion to commence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | They all wake up on the beaches of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] a few days later when the captain and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] travel up the mountain to find them. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] doesn't hear anything from them. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] all decided it would be best to go back up their mountain and check Uti's body and cave to see if they could find or learn anything about what happened or what might happen now that Ebis has the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. Travelling up the mountain again, they find Uti's body fully decomposed and the one made out of solid [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]]. Concerned about the abnormality of the body decomposition rate and the [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] skeleton, they decided to investigate. Mordecai suddenly remembers that they used [Speak With Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead)  from a wild magic surge from a fight a while back. They use it to learn more while Aidan figures out how to return the body to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] to add to the nation's funds. The spell gave them five questions to ask the dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | For the last few days, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] has been travelling back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to retrieve the horse and cart. However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]]          | Before they carry on with their expedition, Korrigan shows Chenris the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|book of poems]] and points to the poem called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes#Golden Walls\|Golden Walls]] and asks if this means the walls around them are not made of real gold. After testing a sample for Pyrite, Chenris sadly concludes the walls are made of fool's gold, putting a hull on their plan to harvest the gold to use to bump the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC's]] finances. The next room of note is a short corridor with a large mirror at the end of it, Mordecai realises that the poem called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes#The Reflection\|The Reflection]] holds the secrets to progressing. The mirror's reflection seems to have some mysterious properties in how it reflects its subjects. There doesn't seem to be any distortion to the image, nor the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], only reflecting the viewer. Reading the poem, Chenris suggest saying words of affirmation to the mirror but this has no effect. Korrigan attempts to simply walk through, but when he is unable to pass he doesn't feel the cool and smooth surface he expected. Instead, it was as if he bumped into himself as he felt skin, bone a cloth. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] takes some time to study the poem and suggests they should try treating the reflection with some respect. Mordecai greets the reflection and politely says "After you". The reflection smiles and says "No I insist, after you" before moving out of the way. The rest do the same and walk straight through.   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]]          | On one side of the room is an impossibly large amount of [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]]. On the other side is the Mummy Lord, seemingly asleep, in front of the Lord is an onyx black sword. They all hesitate before entering, [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|Poems from the Sand Dunes]] still had some unused poems, however, none of them could figure out how they might be used in this situation. Korrigan summons the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] to interact with the room and once it touched the gold coins, the Mummy Lord awoke. [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] starts to shake violently upon its revival and sand begins to fall from the ceiling. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are then presented with a dilemma: the door to the room is slowly closing, should they enter or leave? All but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] were able to dive into the room before the door shut. Now they were left face-to-face with the master of the temple. The Mummy Lord speaks angrily in Infernal to the group, Mordecai, being the only one to speak the language responds with Message. The Lord is confused, not knowing where he is. Mordecai tries to explain he is in a temple on the boundary of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], The Mummy Lord's anger and confusion increase as he is unaware of those names. He exclaims, that he is the ruler of a grand and ancient kingdom in the desert where many adored him. They then make the link between the poem and the Mummy Lord's life and explain he was betrayed. This only seems to fully unleash the lord's wrath, as he summons his sword from the ground and stands from his golden throne. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | There are no guards at the walls, so they're able to go straight to the tavern. The door to the tavern is broken and they can hear people inside talking. Mordecai and Korrigan decide to eavesdrop on the convocation. The people are talking about sharpening their weapons and getting ready for something. Mordecai puts his ear to the door and and accidentally falls into the tavern. As soon as this happens, he pretends to be really drunk and one of the men looks at their sword before saying that he'll take them back to their house. Mordecai explains he isn't local and is from [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. Carrying on, he explains that he is a person of many homes. The man thinks this means he is homeless. Mordecai denies this and explains that he travels all over and accidentally mentions the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and man seems shocked as they apparently don't see many OFC folk around anymore with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | After a short walk, they approach [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] and find that the regular path into the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] runs right under the structure. Mordecai investigates in-depth to find some form entrance and tries randomly knocking on the wall. Suddenly the entrance appears and reveals a dark long corridor inside. Before actually entering the corridor, Mordecai worries that once they enter, the door might close behind them. Chenris shares their suspicion and decide to test the door my chucking a stick into  [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]], as it land the door slowly starts to lower. once the door has closed, Mordecai opens it again but the mechanism gets stuck open this time. they then realise that whatever is in there can get out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Mordecai and Chenris decide to see what the priest of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is like. This room is full of fire brazers, torches and other flame iconography. They find the priest waiting for them and gives them a warm greeting. Mordecai asks if he sees many visitors. He explains that he doesn't get a lot from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] but he does get a handful from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 15\|Session 15]] | The Hooded figure found what he was looking for, Chenris knows that Xekai is using forbidden magic. Xekai is the one that killed Caydan. He knew Mordecai + Drache even though they were pretending to be dumb. He silences Drache because he found then annoying and prefers talking to Mordecai. since he has everything he needs, he opens a portal and Mordecai "accidentally" falls in the portal and manages to pickpocket some of the pages that he had stolen.

[[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s forces are slowly approaching and would arrive very soon. She also questions them heavily on whatever the fuck they did yesterday since within the walls of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] there was a black dragon, fairies, Tree ents, goblins, trolls and airships. They apologise and say these are their forces to back up the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] in [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. She gives a big sigh and asks them to go their strategy for the war. Chenris explains that through research he conducted, he realised that there was a high probability that the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] would be pincered from land and from the back by sea since [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] have a massive and powerful fleet. He aims to use [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] to create a impassable storm to make the seas impassible to lock that side of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and force all [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s to attack on land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
