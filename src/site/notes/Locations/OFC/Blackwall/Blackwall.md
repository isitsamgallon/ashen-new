[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] insisted that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't have Cancer, which only convinced them that they had "Death Disease". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say something else, but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] stepped in, saying that he had a way to make [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] feel better. They said they would be more than happy to have a distraction, and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] teleported both of them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]].

They tentatively approached and knocked on the door, and the beautiful [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] they once knew was now very old, she instantly recognised them and invited them in.

They finally left [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] and had an extremely good time. Along the way, they heard some strange singing; [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] sent [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bobs\|Bobs]] to investigate and learnt that it seemed like people were dancing around a fire. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] sarcastically asked if they should say hi, to which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sarcastically replied that they should. Missing the sarcasm, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] says "OK!" before running over to say hi before the others could stop them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

With nothing else to do they decide to write a note and have it sent to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] to tell her they're not mad and they could meet them at the local tavern or at [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. With that they went to the mail room which was located in the teleportation area of the university.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

[[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | Aidan had decided to not separate from the group and go to the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to cure his Mummy Rot. Having received his healing he felt more powerful than ever and felt that if he raised his hands at that very moment, then something big would happen. As he did so the world around him slowed to a halt, as a cruel God's laughter could be heard echoing in his head. No matter what he tried, time was stuck in this state of sinful silence. With little else to do, he began to wonder. The once familiar and vibrant world around him was now a shadow of itself, cold and unmoving. Eventually, he found his way to the wear the party had left the horse and carriage and moved them to a safe place in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] then wondered to what he hoped was [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]]. When all was said and done, Aidan had spent nearly a week wondering this wasteland alone desperate to hear anything that wasn't the laughter of his cruel patron. Eventually, he found the fort where he discovered Korrigan stuck motionless on the path. As he looked upon his party member, the world slowly started to spin again as time resumed its march forward. |
