### Overview
The estate of the Duke of Twopines. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first travelled here in response to a quest from the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] about the Duke's missing daughter. In reality, his daughter was already dead and had been taken by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. This is the village that started the quest to stop [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] did have a chance to get her back, but they would've had to sacrifice some of their life span, which just isn't an option for most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan. |
