| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | Aiden returned to the Clerk to ask if they had any information on Shoni Anaphora. Without a word, the Clerk began flipping through his old scrolls, revealing they were in luck. Though the records were usually poorly maintained, Shoni was quite famous in the area, and her record was better preserved. The Clerk informed Aiden that she had returned to [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] a few years ago and could be found in [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]]. When Aiden asked if he knew where [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]] was, the Clerk smirked and told the rogue it was still by the river, as it always had been.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] joined in on the laughter, with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 's hearty chuckle rising above the others as he commented on how typically towns moved around. Once the laughter died, the Clerk explained that [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]] was much harder to relocate than other places due to its significant military presence. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] 's interest was piqued at this mention, prompting him to ask whether this military was [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] 's Military or belonged to someone else. The Clerk sighed in irritation and clarified that [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] had no unified force; not even [[Groups & Factions/The Watchers\|The Watchers]] could be termed a "unified force." He likened it to the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]], which had a cohesive military presence. At this, a few guards snickered before quickly regaining their composure.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]] | Looking up from their glass, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly explained that this could work out well for them, as their [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan would take them right to [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]], allowing for a quick detour to look for her. They asked if Aiden had managed to find out exactly where in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the Desert]] they could locate Shoni. Aiden sheepishly admitted that he had forgotten to ask. Returning to the bar with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|the Korrigan]], Aiden requested more information, but the bartender seemed incapable of answering. With a strained voice, Aiden explained that the barkeep would speak more clearly if they offered him some money. However, he was running low on cash. Without hesitation, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|the Korrigan]] pulled out 50 [[gold\|gold]] and asked the same question. The bartender promptly accepted the [[gold\|gold]] and, in an incredibly posh accent, explained that Shoni was in [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]], which was near a river she was working on. He even provided them with the coordinates A61. |
