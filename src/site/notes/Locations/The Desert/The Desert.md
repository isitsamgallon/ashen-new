| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]     | The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] joined in on the laughter, with [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] 's hearty chuckle rising above the others as he commented on how typically towns moved around. Once the laughter died, the Clerk explained that [[Locations/The Desert/Camp Sophia\|Camp Sophia]] was much harder to relocate than other places due to its significant military presence. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] 's interest was piqued at this mention, prompting him to ask whether this military was [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] 's Military or belonged to someone else. The Clerk sighed in irritation and clarified that [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]] had no unified force; not even [[Groups & Factions/The Watchers\|The Watchers]] could be termed a "unified force." He likened it to the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]], which had a cohesive military presence. At this, a few guards snickered before quickly regaining their composure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s corpse becomes quiet. |
