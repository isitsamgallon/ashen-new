### Overview  
The Great Wall is a monumental fortification that divides the **Verdant Peninsula** from **The Desert**. Constructed in the aftermath of the **First Sundering**, the Wall serves as the first and greatest line of defence against external threats. Towering over 50 feet tall and stretching beyond the horizon, the Wall remains an enduring symbol of vigilance, sacrifice, and mystery.

### Construction & Purpose  
Built from the same stone as the surrounding mountains, the Great Wall was designed to delay any future catastrophes or invasions. According to the Wall’s clerks, while it cannot prevent another Sundering, it could delay such a disaster by up to a decade—time enough for the Verdant Peninsula to prepare or evacuate.

The Wall maintains strict neutrality, operating independently from the region’s political factions. Its sole purpose is defence, and it does not involve itself in the broader governance of the Peninsula.

### The Guards of the Wall
Soldiers stationed along the Wall wear suits of shimmering silver armour and are posted at regular intervals, with guard towers every hundred meters. These soldiers represent a wide variety of species—over thirty have been identified—but share one unifying mystery: they are the same individuals who manned the Wall at its creation.

The clerks revealed that the guards are magically bound to the Wall through their armour, preventing them from aging or leaving their posts. While once volunteers, the garrison now exists in a permanent state of service, their autonomy seemingly surrendered to the enchantments that sustain them.

The armour itself appears to have no concern for the wellbeing of its wearers, instead prioritising the Wall’s eternal vigilance. This has given rise to an unsettling aura that hangs over the Wall and its protectors.

### Administration  
The Great Wall is managed by a collective of clerks and guards. There is no single leader; decisions are made collectively and the Wall is treated almost as a sentient entity, self-sustaining and self-governing. Historically, the Wall relied on volunteers, but as fewer individuals offered their service, the enchanted binding of soldiers became the norm.

Clerks at the Wall maintain ancient scrolls and records, though many are incomplete or poorly preserved. Despite this, key figures such as those linked to **Camp Sophia** are still documented.

### Crossing the Wall  
Passage across the Wall into **The Desert** is permitted but strongly discouraged. Travellers who cross are rarely able to return without taking dangerous alternate routes through settlements like **Lost Haven**. The desert beyond is unstable and lacking a central authority, with no unified military to offer protection.

Military power in the desert is fragmented among various nomadic families, each maintaining private forces. Unlike the cohesive armies of the Verdant Peninsula, these forces act independently and often have competing interests.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]]     | Once they had gathered their things, they moved on. Heading outside, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] realised they were only about an hour's walk from [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]]. The road was straightforward from then on, reaching [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]], the next stop on the Tour Du Ashen. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] reminded them that afterwards, they should stop in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] to investigate those dissaprences. They walked silently, with none quite knowing what to say. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] eventually broke the silence by asking if everyone was okay, as they were chained upside down in that dungeon. Everyone reported being okay, as many had experienced worse on their adventures. Kerrigan had slight burns where the iron touched their skin, but he was also fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]]     | Carrying on, they walked alongside [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]], constantly feeling the many gazes watch them suspiciously. Came to a space in the Wall that had to make room for a huge castle gate guarded by 100s of guards. Off to the side, they saw a small door, which they assumed was an information office. Approaching, none of the guards reacted, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] knocked on the open door, and they were invited in. A guard inside extended an arm silently, gesturing them to the Clerk's desk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]     | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. Uti's body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. Uti explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. Uti explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. Uti explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. Uti explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, Uti's corpse becomes quiet. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | With their preparations made, Drache opens the bookcase and steps out into the familiar storage room of the fort, mostly filled with boxes of rations. They hope that most should be asleep, allowing them to move through the fort without encountering many people. They quietly open the door and are confronted with an empty courtyard with a fountain. They take a right and along a path, they encounter a heavy wooden door, Drache explains this is the throne room, and they will have to be as quiet as possible in there or be spotted and tortured. Putting an ear to the door they can hear a man snoring. Drache, assuming it is Damascus, explains that he is a light sleeper so be careful as they all sneak in. Klyn is asleep on his throne, there are many knick-knacks strewn about the place as well as various notes, maps and journals.  As they are passing through Chenris garners at the maps to see if they hold any useful information. The maps have most major cities marked, and highlight where Tulan troops patrol. It seems they never go beyond [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] to the south, and keep a wide birth from [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]].                                                                                                                                                                                           |
