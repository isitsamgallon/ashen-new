### Overview  
The Great Wall is a monumental fortification that divides the **Verdant Peninsula** from **The Desert**. Constructed in the aftermath of the **First Sundering**, the Wall serves as the first and greatest line of defence against external threats. Towering over 50 feet tall and stretching beyond the horizon, the Wall remains an enduring symbol of vigilance, sacrifice, and mystery.

### Construction & Purpose  
Built from the same stone as the surrounding mountains, the Great Wall was designed to delay any future catastrophes or invasions. According to the Wall’s clerks, while it cannot prevent another Sundering, it could delay such a disaster by up to a decade—time enough for the Verdant Peninsula to prepare or evacuate.

The Wall maintains strict neutrality, operating independently from the region’s political factions. Its sole purpose is defence, and it does not involve itself in the broader governance of the Peninsula.

### The Guards of the Wall
Soldiers stationed along the Wall wear suits of shimmering silver armour and are posted at regular intervals, with guard towers every hundred meters. These soldiers represent a wide variety of species—over thirty have been identified—but share one unifying mystery: they are the same individuals who manned the Wall at its creation.

The clerks revealed that the guards are magically bound to the Wall through their armour, preventing them from aging or leaving their posts. While once volunteers, the garrison now exists in a permanent state of service, their autonomy seemingly surrendered to the enchantments that sustain them.

The armour itself appears to have no concern for the wellbeing of its wearers, instead prioritising the Wall’s eternal vigilance. This has given rise to an unsettling aura that hangs over the Wall and its protectors.

### Administration  
The Great Wall is managed by a collective of clerks and guards. There is no single leader; decisions are made collectively and the Wall is treated almost as a sentient entity, self-sustaining and self-governing. Historically, the Wall relied on volunteers, but as fewer individuals offered their service, the enchanted binding of soldiers became the norm.

Clerks at the Wall maintain ancient scrolls and records, though many are incomplete or poorly preserved. Despite this, key figures such as those linked to **Camp Sophia** are still documented.

### Crossing the Wall  
Passage across the Wall into **The Desert** is permitted but strongly discouraged. Travellers who cross are rarely able to return without taking dangerous alternate routes through settlements like **Lost Haven**. The desert beyond is unstable and lacking a central authority, with no unified military to offer protection.

Military power in the desert is fragmented among various nomadic families, each maintaining private forces. Unlike the cohesive armies of the Verdant Peninsula, these forces act independently and often have competing interests.
