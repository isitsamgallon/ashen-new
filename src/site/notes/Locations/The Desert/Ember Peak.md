### Overview
A tall volcano found in [[Locations/The Desert/Emberfall\|Emberfall]]. It is a mountain said to be the gateway between worlds. The peak was no ordinary mountain; it was a living embodiment of elemental fury, a place where the boundaries between planes grew thin, and where the gods themselves could be trapped—if the right sacrifice was made.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]     | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] ignored them and asked who commanded these forces if no unified groups were in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the desert]]. The Clerk explained that several large [[Groups & Factions/Nomad Families\|Nomad Families]] each maintained their own guards and armies on retainer. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then inquired if their role was to prevent another Sundering should it occur. He asked whether they regularly checked places like [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the Broken Throne. The Clerk responded that they had no part in that and mostly left it to external researchers, adding, "We used to, but for reasons, people stay here."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]     | They explained that they were holding a funeral for their friend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]], who had recently been killed by an [[Orcs\|orc]] called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been everywhere in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], "from [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] and the [[Locations/The Desert/Broken Ember Throne\|Broken Ember Throne]]," impressing everyone. they then revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]] had been involved in many of the world's recent events, including [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], and even joined the hunt for a missing [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] with the [[Groups & Factions/Fruit Cutters\|Fruit Cutters]][^6].  Seeing that it was getting a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] late, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] excused themselves, not before promising to get revenge for them if they ever ran into [[Named Characters & Beasts/Wartooth\|Wartooth]] on their travels. Before leaving, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] performed a funeral rite for them and sent the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Karnal\|Karnal]]'s soul to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s as he felt that this would be the best place for a person who loves adventure.                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Korrigan asked if he knew of any other way of keeping the gods at bay. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] revealed that the only thing that could work would be a steady stream of influential people being sacrificed at [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], just like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]]'s surface. It would be the only way to keep the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]] active without having to use [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] knew someone cackled [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | Entering the room, freshly liberated of its bandaged threat, they called over Chenris to help investigate a rather [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Old Pyramid Map\|large and ancient map]] laid out on the table before them. After having a good laugh at the arrow in Mordecai's chest, he takes a look at the map while Korrigan heals the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]]. The map's age made it a challenge to read much of the information it once held, however, there are 4 things they're able to make out: an image of a volcano in a desert and 3 names of towns or cities; [[Locations/The Desert/Peyabo\|Peyabo]], [[Locations/The Desert/Sumene\|Sumene]] and [[Locations/The Desert/Falkwayn\|Falkwayn]]. Chenris assumes the volcano is probably [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], but has no idea about the 3 towns mentioned. They decide to stash the map in their packs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | Korrigan casts the spell to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and receives a warm welcome. He returns the warm greeting and remarks on how nice it is to talk to such an amazing being and asks if he could answer some questions he had. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] says he doesn't know everything but will endeavour to do his best to help. Korrigan asks if there is another way to stop the gods from interacting with the material plane. The God says he only knows of one other way to stop the Gods. It explains that pushing back something powerful requires a sacrifice of life. Korrigan asks for clarification on what he means by life and asks if they could use a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] in its place. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] explains that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|someone]] has already sacrificed themselves before, they bound themselves to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] to stop the Gods during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. Legend has it that every 50 years this person is able to walk the planes but has to return very quickly.                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]] | Chenris says they should go to the Library and learn about the Dwarves in the library and then send ofd the quest to recover the cities riches. While they're at it, they should also exonerate Horrigan. Going to the library, Korrigan tries to find any information on [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] but cant find anything. Chenris, having better luck finds a book detailing the history of the Dwarves called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy\|The Chronicles of the Grayfall Empire - A Dwarven Legacy]]. Before they leave Chenris wants to go to the deans office to try and learn anything abouit [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]]'s whereabouts. He finds a lot of notes on what he was researching but most of seems to be the scribbles of a madman, however one of the notes says "[[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]" there's another that mentions the locations [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]]. Finally, there are a few mentions of a place called "[[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]]" a place on another continent to the one where the campaign is set. Korrigan searches the desk and finds [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Map to Itone\|a faded map that shows how to get to Itone]] |
