| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. Uti's body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. Uti explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. Uti explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. Uti explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. Uti explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, Uti's corpse becomes quiet. |
