### Overview
The home nation of the Humans in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|The Emperor]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Galen is from a long line of Verixs who have ruled the nation for over 500 years after liberating it from the Dwarves in what came to be known as [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|The Cleansing]] led by his ancestor [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]]. The Dawn was one of the magic factions that made up [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. During this period The Dawn had a very good relationship with [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] after many wars. However, sometime after the Sundering, the nations began to despise each other again, causing [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] which sprouted the offshoot nation called The [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | For the next 5 to 10 minutes, Kaelis insulted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s magical skills while answering various questions about what he was doing and showcasing several mind-blowing magical feats. He explained that he had observed [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] slowly collapsing without its leader and saw it as the perfect opportunity to claim what was rightfully his: the crown. He shared stories of his time during the fall of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and his experiences in laying the foundation for most fire magic that followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing.

However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The guard calms down, stating it's a shame he had been inflicted with that. The samurai then ask for their papers, but due to their teleporting into the country, they don't have any papers. After some faffing about to give time for Mordecai to come up with an excuse, they finally explain that they accidentally burnt the paper after mistaking them for campfire tinder. The guard believes them, saying that it happens to everyone at least once, and begins to write them some temporary papers, asking where they are headed. They say to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], and the guard fills in all the information. (they got a traders permit when they first entered Uvam, but that is out of date, meaning that there is no record of them entering the country).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] asks how long the tunnels have been around, but Drache has no idea, they existed before he or Damascus arrived, with the fort leader arriving some 20 years ago. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] states that if they have any last-minute preparations to make then do them now. He has to go on ahead so people don't get suspicious. Before he leaves Drache asks if much has changed since he left. The half-orc glumly tells him most things haven't changed, Klyn has gone mad and even sided with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the war]], so people are losing faith in his leadership fast. Drache promises to repay the favour, but the orc will have none of it and opens the false backing, disappearing into the fort. Korrigan takes this time to cast Pass Without Trace while Mordecai uses [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619102-disguise-self) to change his appearance to match an extremely buff half-orc, Drache gives him a flirty wink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

On the other side is the Mummy Lord, seemingly asleep, in front of the Lord is an onyx black sword. They all hesitate before entering, [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes\|Poems from the Sand Dunes]] still had some unused poems, however, none of them could figure out how they might be used in this situation. Korrigan summons the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Man-Eating Horse\|Man-Eating Horse]] to interact with the room and once it touched the gold coins, the Mummy Lord awoke. [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] starts to shake violently upon its revival and sand begins to fall from the ceiling. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are then presented with a dilemma: the door to the room is slowly closing, should they enter or leave? All but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] were able to dive into the room before the door shut. Now they were left face-to-face with the master of the temple. The Mummy Lord speaks angrily in Infernal to the group, Mordecai, being the only one to speak the language responds with Message. The Lord is confused, not knowing where he is. Mordecai tries to explain he is in a temple on the boundary of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], The Mummy Lord's anger and confusion increase as he is unaware of those names. He exclaims, that he is the ruler of a grand and ancient kingdom in the desert where many adored him. They then make the link between the poem and the Mummy Lord's life and explain he was betrayed. This only seems to fully unleash the lord's wrath, as he summons his sword from the ground and stands from his golden throne. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Upon hearing this, Korrigan enters the tavern apologising for his drunk friend and ask if they're getting ready for a fight like potentially at the [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. They say their not in the grave robbing business and mostly do protection work. To keep the conversation going he offers to buy them a drink. He gets a drink but the bartender insinuates that it's free without saying anything out loud. The man explains that they have been protecting the village since [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s guards stop protecting the town and disappeared. They mostly are protecting people from bandits and thieves  and complains that The Dawn isn't as safe as it used to be. People apparently used to be able to travel without issue but now people are being murdered and robbed and their carriages are being raided. Korrigan shows them their carriage and asks if he recognises if who it belongs to. He doesn't know them personally but explains it's part of the [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]]'s fleet. Chenris, who stayed with the carriage asks where they could find one and is told they're in most major cities. Korrigan offers to help with watch but is turned down and as the man and his crew take great pride in in protecting the village. They get a room and go to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | The next morning, Chenris questions the bartender about what happened to all the people in the village and the bartender signs that they might behave been attacked by wolves but its unclear. Mordecai uses [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) to make the conversation easier. The bartender is ecstatic at the fact he can so easily get his point across. According to him, the village was attacked a lot so people slowly started to move elsewhere, really anywhere but [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. They don't know the specifics, but the bartender recalls that one night all the guards just left and they locked up [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and no one has heard form them since. [[Gold\|Gold]] is now pretty much worthless so he didn't see the reason for asking for payment for the drink last night. Chenris thanks him for his time and enderse to return once they find out what happened                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

As they're traveling. they walk past [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]] and find it almost empty, vastly different to the last time they traveled by. They arrive at the bridge that gives them access to the temple before they hear someone giggling from a nearby push. Korrigan investigates, wanting to get in on the joke and find a small human who tells him to go away. Mordecai wildly misses throwing an acorn at the boy.
