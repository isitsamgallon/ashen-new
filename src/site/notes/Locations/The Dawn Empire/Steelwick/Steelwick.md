### Overview
Steelwick is the home city of [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and is found a little ways from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]'s boarder. Steelwick is an old mining town adorned with dark and spruce wood building and decorated with precious metals. Steelwick's mines are also home to secret [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] found behind a set of heavy door ([[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]]). The city ended up hiring the services of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] to investigate the dungeon further. 

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was then hired as guards for the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] researchers to explore this dungeon, leading to the discovery of a small ancient Dwarven city with insane amount of history. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] managed to find multiple documents that describe some of the history of the settlement including the fact that it was used during a previous war with the humans.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Kerrigan began to stutter through a sentence about how he just wanted to show her rather than try to explain it with words. She then asked about his death and to explain it in more detail. "Oh, um, we were heading to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]], and this little bitch called Merrick the Wise decided to disturb a dragon, or wyvern, and the wyvern got angry and killed me." He explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] prepared to leave the tavern near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]], antics arise with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's first hangover. Noticing the young Eldarin's discomfort, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] decided the most appropriate action for someone complaining that everything was too bright and too loud was to use prestidigitation to create a ringing in his ears to make it all the more uncomfortable for him. Being smarter than [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] ever gave them credit for, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used his own version of the spell to cancel out the effect before rushing over to the tavern keeper, frantically demanding answers as to why he felt so awful when the previous night the gnome had assured him the absinthe was fine to drink. Taking pity on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's naivety, the gnome dug around behind the bar to produce a pair of glasses with dark-tinted lenses. Once they put them on, the world dimmed to a more palatable brightness for his hungover state, providing a mild [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] of comfort to his weakened state. Eventually, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] cast lesser restoration to relieve the symptoms and the shades were gifted to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]]          | She asks where they got this book since it is quite heretical to own a piece of material that looks at [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] in such a good light and the two, slightly panicked explain that they found it in an [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] under [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] surrounded by flames of an exploded researcher. She notes that that is how most followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] tend to operate  (referencing [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]) leading Mordecai to talk about the man that exploded outside the airship and asking about [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]]. Unfortunately, she has no idea what either of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]]          | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] regroups with drache and Korrigan, chenris finding out that the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] have put out a hit on [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] because the goblins blame the group for their invasion of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] not going very well. They leave for [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] as soon as possible and make the illegal crossing route legal so its ok. There's now a small cult that's popped up in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] lead by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]. He has capitalised on the hatred of the other races and used that to gather people to follow him. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] infiltrate his church where they find out he has been kind with people and offered them food while preaching about hatred, which is how he has gathered so many followers. This makes [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] very concerned and they send a messenger to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] to investigate into the cult in their absence. They find the person who crosses the water and get in the boat and head for [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | The party go deliver the two notes to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]]. As they're walking through the town, they note that the town and its soldiers are gearing up a for a large scale attack. In the middle of town is a make ship command centre, where the party meet [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]]. After giving the command the two notes he sends troupes over to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] to give them some protection and upon reading the first note from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] have, commands that the troupes get ready for battle, they are heading to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. He gives them some money for their quest and then heads off to make his own preparations. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] leave, but not before Chenris gets a good look at their battle map to see where troupes are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

As they are traveling through the rolling hills of The Dawn, Aidan spots a mysterious black figure off in the distance. Drawn in he recognises the creature's uncanny lack of face and the familiar pain of looking at [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] too long. Aidan, who had been becoming more and more unstable with matters related to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and his [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|black cult]] immediately yelled in fear and looked away and suffered the penalty to his memory and forgot. His quip of fear immediately alerted the rest of the part to something being wrong questioned the rouge on what scared him so. Upon hearing that he doesn't remember, that group struggle to arrive to a conclusion since they were sure [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] had been vanquished long ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The group reasons that this is what Kal ‡ would’ve wanted. The group eventually find it - it's not a naturally occurring cave, more like it was hollowed out long ago. The lair is full of bookshelves with ancient books written in ancient dwarvish. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] takes one of the books for further study and in the hopes of learning the language. Mordecai Reverence recognised the language from his travels. This language is found all over the cave and even on the four pillars that are holding up the cave. The group decided that it was best to leave for Steelwick to learn not only more about the books but also about what was going on with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
