Found in the mines connected to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] found the place by accepting a quest from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] to investigate some strange doors in the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] mines. The Dungeon was full of puzzles and enemies

> [!Ancient Dwarven Stronghold Puzzles]
> The first room has puzzle in it. there a 4 pedestals , each with a coloured gem on it. Further into the room were more pedestals this time with riddles on them.. the riddles are as following:
> 1. I am the beginning of everything, the foundation upon which all rests. Yet I crumble with the lightest touch. What am I?
> 2. I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?
> 3. I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am i?
> 4.  The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?
> 
> No1 required the Red Gem
> No2 required the Green Gem
> No3 required the White Gem 
> No4 required the Blue Gem

> The next room had a mound of dirt in the middle with 4 tapestries surrounding it. Each had different seasons depicted on it. there were many attempts to solving this puzzle. it ended up requiring a seed to be planted and then be exposed to all the corresponding laments of the seasons to open the way.

> Next was a simple room that had a door in it with the following written above it "OTTFFSS - What comes next?" the answer was "E" because it was **O**ne, **T**wo, **T**hree, **F**our, **F**ive, **S**ix, **S**even, **EIGHT**. 
> 
> Finally the group accounted a room where massive constructs were shovelling lava into a machine. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] noticed mid-fight that the constructs were powered by lava as well, allowing [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to defeat them without anyone dying. to get to the next room there was a massive lava moat to cross. after some time [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] realised there was a water pipe above them they could shoot to make the lava solid.
