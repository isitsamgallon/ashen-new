| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]] | After the events of the previous night, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] leisurely walked the winding path back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Fairset Port\|Fairset Port]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], looking for a pleasant distraction from his work, decided to join them. It was either from exhaustion or shock that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] stuck around after one of his random appearances. Still, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was at a loss for words but expressed his excitement at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s presence nonetheless. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] chuckled lightly as if he were a headteacher with a young student eager to meet him.  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] continued along the road, soon passing [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Fairset Port\|Fairset Port]]. In the distance, they could see many townsfolk running around in a panic. Everyone felt bad about what had happened, particularly [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], who looked predominantly downcast. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to cheer everyone up by reminding them that the vampires would sort out the town; still, everyone knew it would take some time for that support to materialize for the small fishing village. They carried on in silence. |
