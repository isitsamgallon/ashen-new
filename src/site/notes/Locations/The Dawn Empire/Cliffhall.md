### Overview
Cliffhall is a small town found to the west of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. The town was relatively unremarkable, however, when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first visited they learnt that it was actually being haunted by the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]]. A [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] that had the ability to change people's memories or interrupt their sleep. This led to various people going missing or the guards having no energy to perform their duties.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | According to him, he was travelling to Uvam and ran into a woman travelling alone, so he invited her to join him as they were going in a similar direction. One thing led to another, and they 'made camp' together that night. That night, he woke up to find he could not move or speak. All he could do was watch as the women stole his stuff, including the clothes off his back. He explains that he wants to kill her and get his stuff back and is willing to pay them to help him do this. Korrigan tries to make a deal that they help him find, but he isn't allowed to kill her. He explains that that would be tough since he suspects she must be a powerful witch and would have no hope of beating her. They compromise by saying that they will help him get his stuff back while she is restrained and not killed, and they get all the items on her that aren't his. They agree and begin to track her. They come up with a plan that korrigan will track her down from her footprints, etc, and when they're close, Chenris will use [Locate Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-object) to narrow it down greatly. Korrigan casts a spell that greatly aids him in finding her tracks and follows them to a forest in between [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]]. The tracks look quite fresh, so chenris uses Locate Object and learns she has set up camp by a nearby stream. And says they could reach her quickly and surprise her in the night to get their stuff back. |

Chenris also comments how quite it was when they walk past earlier so it would be good to learn what happened and possibly even find out what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. They head out and just as they are crossing the bridge, they see a carriage and horse stranded by the roadside, they can also see that the driver had been murdered with most of the cargo being stolen. Assuming it's the guy who was hiding in the bush earlier that day, they scope out the area to make sure he isn't nearby. Aidan suggests taking the cart and Korrigan wants to befriend the horse and it seems to like him. They decide that taking the horse and carriage will make it easier to travel and could give people a chance to rest. Chenris sits in the carriage to read  exclaiming how nice it is to since he cant read and walk. Mordecai also sits and take the time to tunes his instruments. They make good time and arrive at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]] just as the sun is setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
