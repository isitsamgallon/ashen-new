### Overview
A cave found on the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] where a Wyvern had been living. Inside, many dwarven books can be found, as well as well-preserved dwarven architecture. 

### Notable Information 
- It was later discovered that one of the bookcases was a fake and led to a previously unexplored area that was revealed to be a hiding place for a family of Dwarfs during [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|The Cleansing]] and was another entrance to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | Korrigan pulls out the map and asks where they should be going. Chenris suggest going to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and stopping by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to see what happened to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. Korrigan suggests we also go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] since it's on the way to Dawnhaven. Mordecai asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] if she has anywhere she wants to go, but she says she doesn't have anywhere she specifically wants to go, but she should probably return to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] soon, her people probably already think she's dead or kidnapped, although she mentions that she wants to see [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] before going home. Fearing the worst, Mordecai asks how they would pick a new emperor. She explains that one of the lords would be elected into power but that it would take at least 30 years to pick a new ruler, Chenris is surprised, asking, "That quickly?"                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]] | The next morning, they woke up and headed straight for the Wyvern Cave. Approaching the cave, korrigan starts to have PTSD flashbacks and is unable to cross the threshold of the cave. Instead, opting to [Wild Shape](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) into a Stoat and hide. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] sighs and tells Chenris and Mordecai she watches over him. Entering the cave, they quickly began their search, Chenris scanned the bookshelves and found very few interesting as most were fairytale books or fiction books. As he scanned the book, one caught his eye: [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Unbroken Coin - A Tale of Two Brothers\|The Unbroken Coin - A Tale of Two Brothers]]. It was an ancient-looking red leather-bound book with two golden masks on the front. Skimming through the book, he knew it was important and began to read. Just as he finished the first page, Mordecai called out to him.                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are getting ready to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] decides it would be best for him to scout the area out ahead of time and to meet him in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] when they can make it. The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time. |
