### Overview
A cave found on the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] where a Wyvern had been living. Inside, many dwarven books can be found, as well as well-preserved dwarven architecture. 

### Notable Information 
- It was later discovered that one of the bookcases was a fake and led to a previously unexplored area that was revealed to be a hiding place for a family of Dwarfs during [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|The Cleansing]] and was another entrance to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]].
