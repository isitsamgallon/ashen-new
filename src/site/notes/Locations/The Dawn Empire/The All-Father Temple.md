### Overview
The All Father Temple is a combined church for every member of [[The Ashen Pantheon\|The Ashen Pantheon]], including [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|The All-Father]]. Located near the border of [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|The OFC]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], it is a large marble building with a small encampment around it. Inside was a truly massive library that had a door to each of the Gods going to their dedicated room.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' Room
The heavy heat radiating from the entrance was palpable, even from a distance. As they stepped through the arched doorway, the air around them thickened with an almost oppressive warmth. The room inside was bathed in the glow of countless flames, flickering and casting wild shadows across the walls. Fire brazers lined the perimeter, their flames crackling and dancing with a life of their own. Torches mounted on every column cast long, jagged shadows that seemed to sway and twist, reflecting the chaotic nature of the god to whom the room was dedicated.

The walls were adorned with flame iconography—carvings of ancient battles, cities consumed in infernos, and symbols of purification through destruction. It was a place that embodied the power of fire not only as a force of chaos but as a tool for renewal. The heat was stifling, but it was more than just the physical warmth—it was the divine presence of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], his essence woven into every corner of the chamber.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s Room
The portal was wreathed in fey magic, immediately transported to what seemed like a slice of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] itself. The air was thick with the scent of wildflowers and damp earth, and the light shifted and danced, moving between vibrant hues of green, purple, and gold. Everywhere one looked, the boundaries of the room were blurred—vines sprouted from the walls and floor, growing and weaving in real-time, giving the impression that the room was alive and breathing. The laughter of unseen beings echoed around the room, and as one moved further in, the very ground beneath him seemed to shift, as though he was walking atop a living entity.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' Room
Standing before the portal leading to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' domain, there was a distinct shift in the air, an unnatural weight that settled around them. It felt as though the flow of time itself slowed as they stepped through, the familiar hum of magic that accompanied these transitions warping into a strange, discordant rhythm. On the other side, they were greeted by a room that defied the very concept of time. Clocks hung suspended in midair, each ticking at a different pace. Some hands raced forward in a blur, while others crawled along slowly, almost imperceptibly. The room itself felt like a disjointed moment, as if every second here was caught between now and never.

At the back of the room, near the altar, a large disturbance in time rippled through the air like the surface of a disturbed pond. Crystals floated lazily around the disturbance, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]’s sharp eyes immediately recognized them. These were the same crystals that crowned the tops of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]], remnants of the ancient magic that guarded the boundaries of time itself.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s Room
The air around it shimmered with magic, as though the very fabric of reality was thinner here, fragile and delicate. Crossing the threshold, the room that greeted them was a place of quiet wonder and ethereal beauty. Books floated in mid-air, pages turning softly without being touched, the written words glowing faintly as though alive with knowledge. Scrolls drifted lazily, circling the room as if they had been weightless for centuries. The walls were lined with shelves that stretched into infinity, housing tomes that likely held the secrets of ages. It was a library not bound by the constraints of time or space. Everything here moved in a constant, gentle flow as if the room itself were a living, breathing thing.

At the heart of the room, resting upon an ornate altar, was a shimmering orb of light. Its glow was soft but constant, casting the entire space in a golden hue. It looked almost identical to the one found in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s grand library—radiating a silent power and wisdom that filled the room with reverence. The air hummed with the weight of untold knowledge, and anyone who entered knew this was a place where the ordinary laws of life and death could be bent, or even broken.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]]'s Room
This room is unexplored.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' Room
This room took the form for a large white field that was tended by a loan priest.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]     | Coming to the end of their questions, Korrigan asked how many towers were needed to keep the gods at bay, especially with a lot of them falling. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] explained that only one is needed to stop them from entering the world, but with each one falling, people who gain power from the gods would grow stronger. Then the headmaster gave a warning that before long, all of them would fall, including [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] tower, it was not safe as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] already knew where it was. But before they could ask how he knew, Haldir laughed before revealing his true form: an incredibly old man hunched over. he had purple eyes and notably six purple identical[^8] that attached to his back, which kept hovering just above the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s purple portal opens just outside of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], and off in the distance they can see [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] drawing in the mud with a stick as he waits for them. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]] | Their path before them is obstructed by a large grid on the floor. Each column is adorned with different symbols, including A coin, A water droplet, A log of wood, A love heart, A bail of wheat and A skull. Now adept at decoding the secrets of the dungeon, they refer to the poem called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes#The King's Greed\|The King's Greed]] to divine their path safely across the grid. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] find themselves in a room with two doors, one on their left and the other on their right. The one on their left is locked tight, but the right put up no such resistance. Behind the threshold, they are confronted with 4 rooms, all connected by a corridor: A kitchen, An alter room with pews, A bedroom and barracks. In the corridor was a large golden statue of an ancient king, Chenris didn't recognise him as the Mummy Lord from his vision in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. The large statue is holding 7 smaller statuettes: a large round king, a young woman in a dress, a priest, a knight, an old woman with a walking stick, a servant and a veil of poison. Korrigan recognises the statues from the poem called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Poems from the Sand Dunes#A Court of Betrayal\|A Court of Betrayal]], which describes a scene where various figures go about their day in a large manor with an underlying plot to kill the king. The group move the statues to the rooms where they appear in the poem but nothing happens. Aidan decides to investigate further and discovers a small button hidden by the statues. Once pressed, it swings open to reveal the final room. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] | Korrigan then asks why the priest would worship a God that is known to sow so much chaos and misery. The priest says that the God is not all bad is actually response for the passage of time and keeping it moving forward at the right pace. Without [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] it is unknown what would happen to time, it could reverse or speed up. Moving on, they point to the crystals and ask what their purpose is. He explains that they were put their by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|the temple]] founders when the room was constructed to allow people to enter without them rapidly aging. The priest doesn't know much about the crystals themselves since they were there when he arrived and no one really knows either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are getting ready to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] decides it would be best for him to scout the area out ahead of time and to meet him in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]] when they can make it. The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | As they reach the board the wall to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], they find it abandoned and the party are able to walk right through. They decide not to wast any time and head straight to the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. As they're traveling. they walk past [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]] and find it almost empty, vastly different to the last time they traveled by. They arrive at the bridge that gives them access to the temple before they hear someone giggling from a nearby push. Korrigan investigates, wanting to get in on the joke and find a small human who tells him to go away. Mordecai wildly misses throwing an acorn at the boy. Korrigan can't see any traps and decides to walk over the bridge and nothing bad happens, they reach the temple with ease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
