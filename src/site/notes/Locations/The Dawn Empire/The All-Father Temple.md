The All Father Temple is a combined church for every member of [[The Ashen Pantheon\|The Ashen Pantheon]], including [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|The All-Father]]. Located near the border of [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|The OFC]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], it is a large marble building with a small encampment around it. Inside was a truly massive library that had a door to each of the Gods going to their dedicated room.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' Room
The heavy heat radiating from the entrance was palpable, even from a distance. As they stepped through the arched doorway, the air around them thickened with an almost oppressive warmth. The room inside was bathed in the glow of countless flames, flickering and casting wild shadows across the walls. Fire brazers lined the perimeter, their flames crackling and dancing with a life of their own. Torches mounted on every column cast long, jagged shadows that seemed to sway and twist, reflecting the chaotic nature of the god to whom the room was dedicated.

The walls were adorned with flame iconography—carvings of ancient battles, cities consumed in infernos, and symbols of purification through destruction. It was a place that embodied the power of fire not only as a force of chaos but as a tool for renewal. The heat was stifling, but it was more than just the physical warmth—it was the divine presence of Ignatius, his essence woven into every corner of the chamber.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s Room
The portal was wreathed in fey magic, immediately transported to what seemed like a slice of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] itself. The air was thick with the scent of wildflowers and damp earth, and the light shifted and danced, moving between vibrant hues of green, purple, and gold. Everywhere one looked, the boundaries of the room were blurred—vines sprouted from the walls and floor, growing and weaving in real-time, giving the impression that the room was alive and breathing. The laughter of unseen beings echoed around the room, and as one moved further in, the very ground beneath him seemed to shift, as though he was walking atop a living entity.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' Room
Standing before the portal leading to Chronovorus' domain, there was a distinct shift in the air, an unnatural weight that settled around them. It felt as though the flow of time itself slowed as they stepped through, the familiar hum of magic that accompanied these transitions warping into a strange, discordant rhythm. On the other side, they were greeted by a room that defied the very concept of time. Clocks hung suspended in midair, each ticking at a different pace. Some hands raced forward in a blur, while others crawled along slowly, almost imperceptibly. The room itself felt like a disjointed moment, as if every second here was caught between now and never.

At the back of the room, near the altar, a large disturbance in time rippled through the air like the surface of a disturbed pond. Crystals floated lazily around the disturbance, and Korrigan’s sharp eyes immediately recognized them. These were the same crystals that crowned the tops of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]], remnants of the ancient magic that guarded the boundaries of time itself.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s Room
The air around it shimmered with magic, as though the very fabric of reality was thinner here, fragile and delicate. Crossing the threshold, the room that greeted them was a place of quiet wonder and ethereal beauty. Books floated in mid-air, pages turning softly without being touched, the written words glowing faintly as though alive with knowledge. Scrolls drifted lazily, circling the room as if they had been weightless for centuries. The walls were lined with shelves that stretched into infinity, housing tomes that likely held the secrets of ages. It was a library not bound by the constraints of time or space. Everything here moved in a constant, gentle flow as if the room itself were a living, breathing thing.

At the heart of the room, resting upon an ornate altar, was a shimmering orb of light. Its glow was soft but constant, casting the entire space in a golden hue. It looked almost identical to the one found in Aeloria’s grand library—radiating a silent power and wisdom that filled the room with reverence. The air hummed with the weight of untold knowledge, and anyone who entered knew this was a place where the ordinary laws of life and death could be bent, or even broken.
