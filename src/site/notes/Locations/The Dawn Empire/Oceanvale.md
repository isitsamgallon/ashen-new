| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | Exiting the cave, they returned to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] and found a safe spot to set up camp. They all awoke the next morning, saw slightly better, and returned to full health. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly grabbed the vial and, surrounded by their [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|companions]], uncorked the bottle. As soon as they did so, their bodies crumpled to the ground, completely asleep. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] rushed over, pulling them up and shouting at them to wake up, to no avail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | With the lavender in hand, they returned to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]], hoping to find a multifaith church in the town. Entering, they found the city was now less empty than before, but many were still concerned and worried about their loved one who were still missing. Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could interject, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had already approached a nearby guard, and judging by the insignia on the armour, they were one of the flaming sons. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] approached the guard and explained that they were a friend of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis]] Ignithar. The guard didn't believe them until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] showed him the bell used to contact [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Kaelis]] Ignithar.                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]] | Since [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]'s rebirth, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] felt... whole again, a realisation that they had neither the energy nor the desire to investigate further had. Instead, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] posed the question of whether going to the place that had lost all of its food supplies was truly the best idea, especially since they had all been spotted in the town just before everything went missing. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] agreed that it was probably best to skip the Fairest Post and head straight for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]] | A while later, as they approached [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suddenly remembered a quest request they had there. Upon rereading the quest details, the situation sounded very similar to the '[[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]]' they had encountered in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Newhall\|Newhall]]. If that were the case, it would be wise to rest outside the city to avoid being enchanted by the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] in their sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]] | They soon entered [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]], a massive portside town that looked to be the largest city in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]] on this side of the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]]. However, upon entering, they found that it resembled a barely populated fishing village rather than a bustling city. They decided it would be best to visit the local market to ask about their quest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] didn't get the chance to ask what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was talking about; they quickly began walking down the path toward Tulan Fort, muttering under their breath about how geologists weren't real scientists. Suddenly, one of them opened their pack, retrieved a map for the Tour Du Ashen, and explained that their next stop was likely Tulan Fort unless they wanted to return to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]] to check out the goblins outside of it. They decided to continue to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] and possibly check out Tulan along the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 36\|Session 36]] | Once they had gathered their things, they moved on. Heading outside, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] realised they were only about an hour's walk from [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Gimsu\|Gimsu]]. The road was straightforward from then on, reaching [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]], the next stop on the Tour Du Ashen. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] reminded them that afterwards, they should stop in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]] to investigate those dissaprences. They walked silently, with none quite knowing what to say. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] eventually broke the silence by asking if everyone was okay, as they were chained upside down in that dungeon. Everyone reported being okay, as many had experienced worse on their adventures. Kerrigan had slight burns where the iron touched their skin, but he was also fine. |
