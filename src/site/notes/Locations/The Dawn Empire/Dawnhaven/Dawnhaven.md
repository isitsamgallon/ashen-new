### Overview
Dawnhaven is the capital city of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and the residence of Emperor [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. The city appears prosperous, featuring well-constructed and attractive buildings. However, as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ventures off the main streets, the disparity in wealth becomes increasingly apparent.

Dawnhaven is situated at the northwesternmost point of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. However, it disappeared at the end of [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] due to an incredibly complex spell cast by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]]. Its current location remains unknown.

### Known Locations & Affiliations

- [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Silent Shade\|The Silent Shade]] 
- [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]

### Trivia
- When [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] used to be a member of the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] and operated in and around Dawnhaven.
- Note: on the map Dawnhaven is displayed a floating island north of its original location in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. The city is not actually found here and is just placeholder to show its still exists.

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sarcastically exclaimed, "It seems he speaks?!" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] folded his arms and shifted his weight before exclaiming that although this wasn't how he wanted to meet them, it was still nice to see most of them, finding it quite rude that none had said hello to him. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] exclaimed that it was one of the first things he did, but he never responded. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] denied the human's claims, insisting that none had greeted him. Aidan stepped forward and greeted [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]], but he didn't respond. Steeping closer, he asked, "Is that really you? Are you OK?" [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] finally turned to Aidan before curtly remarking, "I'm a ghost... no" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] couldn't help themselves from letting out a short laugh. Aidan stood for a moment before Saying, "I don't know if you can hear me, but I just wanna say... We may not have always seen eye to eye, but I wanted you to know that I respect the fuck out of you. I regret not being able to tell you that back under [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]." Looking slightly confused, [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] replied, "I'm not sure who that is, but don't worry about my sacrifice, it was my way of apologising.

| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | With a heavy sigh, the headmaster explained that, yes, Agolin had once been a student at the university. He was known to be powerful, but he had two other friends who were a lot more gifted mages, especially in combat, which meant his friends were sent to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] and, therefore, died there. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] murmured that it finally made sense [^7]. The headmaster continued his explanation and said that the beings who stole the crystals were known as '[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]', which explained why the ghosts called them [[Other Information/Lightbearers\|lightbearers]] when they came to the crystals in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]] and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

As it gets closer, the details become clearer as they start to make out their features of green hair and fine clothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | The Elf's screams of terror could now be heard in full force as they slowly descended to the ground. Their screams only stopped to admire [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]]'s beautiful purple and silver feathers before quickly returning to screaming. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] roughly drops the elf to the ground before returning to [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]]. As [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is giving them a hand up, the elf mentions that they recognise the group from somewhere, like in a dream or something similar. As they stand up, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|KOrrigan]] notices their purple eyes - a telltale sign of the Fey. Immediately curious, he asks them what a member of the fey is doing falling out of the sky over [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. The elf has no idea what they're talking about since they don't think they're fey. Confused about what the elf is talking about since they're clearly fey from his perspective, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] introduces himself as 'The [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'. As they reach for [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]'s outstretched hand, the elf has a moment of realisation, and with a smile, they shake the hand and exclaim, "Nice to meet you, Kal The [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]]". [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] is visibly shaken since no one else, let alone one of the fey, calls him [[Kal †\|Kal †]] anymore and immediately starts to grill the elf, not caring about asking invasive questions and being very rude. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tries their best to calm [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] down as his questions quickly became shouting commands. |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are all getting into the carriage, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|korrigan]] asks [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] where they are originally from, and after a thing, they explain they are from a small island town called [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], a nation none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever adventured to or heard of. Before the carriage starts to move, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is told in no uncertain terms that they are not to touch anything, especially any old books or notes (Referring to Chenris' notes and items). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] promises they won't. It was about a half-a-day journey from what was [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], and the airship was a few hours from the town. Along the way, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] asks why they don't think they're part of the fey when they have the features of one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]              | An hour after [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], they all reach the remaining frame of the airship, with parts still on fire and a shattered crystal found in the centre of the wreckage. On the walls that hadn't burnt down, the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo could be seen, immediately raising suspicions of [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. While investigating, Aidan is able to confirm that the ship is not the same one from earlier in their adventure. Upon seeing the dead bodies, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] goes incredibly quiet as he tries to hold back his panic. They all begin to edge close ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] less so) to try and learn more from the wreckage. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] takes this time to analyse the magic around the ship and learns that there are faint traces of strange magical energy, information [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] instantly links to the large wave of magic that spread out from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] 's work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also realises that that crystal absolutely shouldn't have shattered since they're quite durable and important to keeping the airship in the air.

The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Reaching Dawnhaven, he was confronted by the same sight as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] with robbed cultists surrounding the city and thick purple mist blanketing the area. However, the party was nowhere to be seen and time did not unfreeze. Sighing deeply, Aidan followed the path back to the Farpost and to his surprise, he encountered the party travelling along the road, however, time did not unfreeze and the mist carried on past them into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. This left Aidan confused since the last time this happened, time resumed once he rejoined the group, perhaps his objective was different this time? Before he left the party he wrote a quick note: "I'm stuck frozen in time, currently following a black mist going to Farpost and beyond". With that, he carried on into Uvam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | The rest of the party is standing on a hill observing the cultists around Dawnhaven, apart from the spell, everything was eerily quiet. When suddenly bright flash of light appears revealing Aidan and Drache on the carriage moving at breakneck speeds crashing into a nearby tree. Mordecai and Korrigan rush over to help and ask what happened and how they got here. Drache is out of breath spluttering "Time weird, tentacles, scared.", with a quick laugh korrigan says "That sounds like a great honeymoon" confusing Chenris greatly as that sounds like a disastrous honeymoon. Mordecai stops that conversation quickly saying that this is not the time to talk about something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Korrigan quickly gets distracted when he realises Drache hasn't seen his new [Wild Shape](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) ability and quickly transforms into a large horse. Drache is impressed and tries to pick it up but the horse is way too heavy for him. Mordecai gets them back on track, as they think everything, including this weird spell at Dawnhaven, is the work of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]] and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. At this, Korrigan says "Chronohorsey" only drache can understand as he is able to understand animals. Transforming back into a Humanoid, korrigan tries his best to remember all of these old Thieves' paths into and out of the city. One of them is fairly close, and chenris surmises that the cult would almost definitely not attack them since the spell they are performing is so complex, it needs their whole focus to maintain it. As they're discussing their options, The ground begins to shake violently as a massive earthquake happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

As they slowly made their way through the tunnel network another earthquake happened causing the tunnel to collapse in on itself. 100s of tonnes of debris began to fall on the party, with most being able to jump out of harm's way, Chenris and Mordecai weren't so lucky. large amounts of concrete fell on Chenris' arm and Mordecai's ankle crushing the bones underneath with sickening crunch. When the earthquake stopped the rest rushed in to help and see how bad the damage was. Checking over their wounds, korrigan learnt that the damage was too much for any healing spell they knew. The spell would fix any of the outside damage but would have no effect on the bone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Korrigan instantly greets him "Hi [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]!" But the masked figure has no idea who that is and simply asks if they are aware that they are trespassing in the palace of Dawnhaven. Mordecai accuses them of doing the exact same thing. Before the man replies, he clicks his fingers and behind him, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] appears kneels by his side and calls the masked man Master. Korrigan can quickly tell that something is controlling him. The man says that they have no idea what he is doing, for all they know, he is trying to save Dawnhaven for the world. Mordecai attempts to cast [[Admin/Spells/Dispel Magic\|Dispel Magic]] but it fails instantly. The man pats Galen on the head and tells him to go back to bed, Galen immediately walks back to bed in a daze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They are to go into the crypts under the city, where their circle meets, and retrieve a crystal hidden behind a door. He explains that they'll need a special tool to retrieve the crystal and asks who the smartest among them is. They all silently point at Chenris. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] nods and passes the device through a portal to Chenris. It had a large shape spike on it and a box with many cogs on it. Chenris was immediately interested since he had never seen such a device before. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] then opens a portal to a very dark and old-looking area that they presumed to be the crypt. and begun to shoo them off to do their job. Chenris immediately gets up to go through. korrigan asks if the man will tell them about the spell happening outside of Dawnhaven but the man refuses and they should be lucky he has been so lenient with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Fearing the worst, Mordecai asks how they would pick a new emperor.

Surrounding them was a thick purple mist, Chenris sensed dark energies being used but was unable to understand their purpose. The magics felt familiar, but none could place where they had felt it from before. A few moments of silence passed as they also looked stunned at the scene. The silence was broken by Korrigan, who said, "Wait, doesn't that purple remind you of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | The next morning, Chenris questions the bartender about what happened to all the people in the village and the bartender signs that they might behave been attacked by wolves but its unclear. Mordecai uses [Message](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) to make the conversation easier. The bartender is ecstatic at the fact he can so easily get his point across. According to him, the village was attacked a lot so people slowly started to move elsewhere, really anywhere but [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. They don't know the specifics, but the bartender recalls that one night all the guards just left and they locked up [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and no one has heard form them since. [[Gold\|Gold]] is now pretty much worthless so he didn't see the reason for asking for payment for the drink last night. Chenris thanks him for his time and enderse to return once they find out what happened                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The group decided on their travel plans for the next few days and decided it would be best to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] since it is on the way and could have a lot of information about the Gods and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. Since they have to go through [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]], they should also take some time to investigate [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] that was summoned during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They also say that if they have the time, they would want to check out [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to look into the strange disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]]. [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] also suggests walking along the Verdant Spine when they travel down to the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] so they can further investigate the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] if they're not in a rush. They head off pretty soon after this and have a very good time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/03 The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]]          | In Elvish Chenris and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] overhear the city guards taking a newspaper article about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|The Emperor]] having gone missing since [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|his war with the OFC]] and that local lords have started taking more land/ control than they normally would leading to a lot of panic. Reportedly [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] is fine and hasn't suffered any loss or control. Mordecai, not understanding any of this, asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] and mentions that Chenris has been trying to translate an [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|old book]] and get the full story but has been struggling with the last few chapters. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] asks to see it and instantly reads the title of the book out in Ancient Dwarfish and then again in Common. Mordecai asks if she can translate it and she does just that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

As they're walking through the town, they note that the town and its soldiers are gearing up a for a large scale attack. In the middle of town is a make ship command centre, where the party meet [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]]. After giving the command the two notes he sends troupes over to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] to give them some protection and upon reading the first note from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] have, commands that the troupes get ready for battle, they are heading to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. He gives them some money for their quest and then heads off to make his own preparations. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] leave, but not before Chenris gets a good look at their battle map to see where troupes are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
