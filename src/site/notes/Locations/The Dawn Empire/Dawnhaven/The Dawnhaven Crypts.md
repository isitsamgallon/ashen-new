### Overview
An ancient Dwarven crypt found under the city of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] that many regard as merely a legend. It became the home of [[Groups & Factions/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]] due to the easy access to dead bodies and the ambiguity around its existence.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | With a heavy sigh, the headmaster explained that, yes, Agolin had once been a student at the university. He was known to be powerful, but he had two other friends who were a lot more gifted mages, especially in combat, which meant his friends were sent to [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] and, therefore, died there. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] murmured that it finally made sense [^7]. The headmaster continued his explanation and said that the beings who stole the crystals were known as '[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]', which explained why the ghosts called them [[Other Information/Lightbearers\|lightbearers]] when they came to the crystals in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]] and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]] | Looking slightly pissed off now, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] surmises that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants them to destroy the tower and then kill him so he doesn't have to deal with the fallout - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] agrees. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] analyses the tower and notes that the crystal isn't at the centre of it like the others. Instead, the crystals line the walls and focus on the tower. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] touches on them, and a husky and laboured voice whispers to him, "[[Other Information/Lightbearers\|Lightbearers]]." [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s head snaps in the direction of the voice, and it is one of the black wraiths they saw in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]]; [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordacai also recognise them from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]]. |
