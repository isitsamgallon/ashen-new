### Overview
A small town in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] seems to have been taken over by the military as part of the preparations during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. It is mostly made up of Military tents and temporary settlements. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]] was in charge of this Farpost until he was given word to march on the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | Later, as they pass by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]], they notice a lot of activity in the town. Many guards clad in bright orange armour are stationed around the city. They decide it would be wise to investigate, as it might provide clues about the identity of the "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Kaelis Ignithar\|Prince of Fire]]," referenced in the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/'Prince Of Fire' Flyer\|'Prince Of Fire' Flyer]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] explained that they were simply passing by, had noticed that [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] was active again, and wanted to understand why. He also requested a way to see what lay ahead before he stumbled over something. With a wave of his hand, the prince restored their vision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] made their way to the border between [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] and the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]], they met a fleet of soldiers guarding the wall. They paused, minds racing on how they were going to get past them again, knowing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s complicated history with them. Chenris' dying words swirled in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s mind as they were finally confronted by their past. How could he save others from their sadness when all he did was run from his own? Impulsively, the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] raised their crimson fingertips to unhook their cloak from over their horns, the sun reflecting off their jewellery like flames coiling through their dark hair. Within seconds, arrows soared through the air. Green vials of sedatives plunged into the necks of our heroes, bringing with them the murky darkness of their consciousness leaving them.                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | For the last few days, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] has been travelling back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to retrieve the horse and cart. However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Reaching Dawnhaven, he was confronted by the same sight as [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] with robbed cultists surrounding the city and thick purple mist blanketing the area. However, the party was nowhere to be seen and time did not unfreeze. Sighing deeply, Aidan followed the path back to the Farpost and to his surprise, he encountered the party travelling along the road, however, time did not unfreeze and the mist carried on past them into the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. This left Aidan confused since the last time this happened, time resumed once he rejoined the group, perhaps his objective was different this time? Before he left the party he wrote a quick note: "I'm stuck frozen in time, currently following a black mist going to Farpost and beyond". With that, he carried on into Uvam.                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | The first town they encounter is [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]]. The last time the party visited, it was a military installation filled with Tents, guards and palisades. Now, it looked all but abandoned, with nearly all of the tents gone or in a state of disrepair. Chenris comments on how this must've happened since we beat them so badly in [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|the war]]. Decide to go around the perimeter to avoid any conflicts with looters, but Chenris can find 15 Gold in the mud. A little way down the road, Chenris spots an incredibly annoyed-looking naked man. Mordecai approaches and asks if he is ok, offering them a clock and some clothes. The man happily accepts them, even though the clothes are a bit too small and frilly and starts to explain his situation.                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] go through the portal back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] and get rid of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Junior\|Captain Junior]] and venture on to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] (much to the fear of the rest of the party) strike a deal of information exchange for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]]'s soul contract, which Chenris reluctantly agrees to. Chenris ends up learning about the [[The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and Korrigan's plans to do something to the pillar in lost haven on behalf of lorwyn. For some reason the party also left these in charge of directions resulting tin the party going the wrong direction. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], concerned that Korrigan had picked up Chenris’ navigation skills, pointed out they needed to turn around.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | Along the road as they're turning around, a [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] caravan full of important weaponry refuses to let us interact with them, Chenris noted that they had a lot of guards and seemed to be going in the direction of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | The party go deliver the two notes to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]]. As they're walking through the town, they note that the town and its soldiers are gearing up a for a large scale attack. In the middle of town is a make ship command centre, where the party meet [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]]. After giving the command the two notes he sends troupes over to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] to give them some protection and upon reading the first note from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] have, commands that the troupes get ready for battle, they are heading to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. He gives them some money for their quest and then heads off to make his own preparations. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] leave, but not before Chenris gets a good look at their battle map to see where troupes are.                                                                                                                                                        |
