| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | Passion [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered two men in incredibly fashionable and interesting clothing [^1]. The two men have a lunch caravan with huge piles of colourful silk. The men stop and proudly ask if [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] would be interested in investing in their futures. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] falls for them and says they would. The men introduce themselves as businessmen for [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]] and begin to describe the concept of silk to them. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is quick on the uptake and says they're quite familiar with silk, mostly the fabric made in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The men admit that this silk isn't as nice as their Elvin silk, but it is a lot cheaper than the stuff from the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | As they ventured through [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] couldn't help but muse at how quiet it was compared to the last time they had been there. Chatter could be heard from the largest building, piquing all of their interests and ideas started to be floated about possible infiltration. Before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was able to grab their make-up palette, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] was keen to experiment further with his new wild shaping ability. Before their very eyes, their fey friend shrunk in size and stature, his humanoid limbs cracking and duplicating in odd angles until all that was left was a spider with [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]’s signature antlers protruding from his tiny head. As a spider, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] scurried up the walls of the building and squeezed his small form into the tiniest crack in the wall to be an unnoticed witness to whatever large gathering they had stumbled across.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | According to him, he was travelling to Uvam and ran into a woman travelling alone, so he invited her to join him as they were going in a similar direction. One thing led to another, and they 'made camp' together that night. That night, he woke up to find he could not move or speak. All he could do was watch as the women stole his stuff, including the clothes off his back. He explains that he wants to kill her and get his stuff back and is willing to pay them to help him do this. Korrigan tries to make a deal that they help him find, but he isn't allowed to kill her. He explains that that would be tough since he suspects she must be a powerful witch and would have no hope of beating her. They compromise by saying that they will help him get his stuff back while she is restrained and not killed, and they get all the items on her that aren't his. They agree and begin to track her. They come up with a plan that korrigan will track her down from her footprints, etc, and when they're close, Chenris will use [Locate Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-object) to narrow it down greatly. Korrigan casts a spell that greatly aids him in finding her tracks and follows them to a forest in between [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Cliffhall\|Cliffhall]]. The tracks look quite fresh, so chenris uses Locate Object and learns she has set up camp by a nearby stream. And says they could reach her quickly and surprise her in the night to get their stuff back. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session 10]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] go through the portal back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] and get rid of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Junior\|Captain Junior]] and venture on to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[Kal †\|Kal †]] (much to the fear of the rest of the party) strike a deal of information exchange for [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]]'s soul contract, which Chenris reluctantly agrees to. Chenris ends up learning about the [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and Korrigan's plans to do something to the pillar in lost haven on behalf of lorwyn. For some reason the party also left these in charge of directions resulting tin the party going the wrong direction. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], concerned that Korrigan had picked up Chenris’ navigation skills, pointed out they needed to turn around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 08\|Session 08]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are traveling to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] to try and find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] to free [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] from his contract with the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]. Along the way they make a stop at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]]. As soon as they enter the small village they are taken in by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|DUstwood]] guards to a questioning room. Through being questioned [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] find out that [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] has murdered his father [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord Ulan †]]. He is currently on trail and facing an almost certain death sentence. However, according to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] law, all known associates of the murderer involved in the murder of lord are responsible for the murder of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord Ulan †]] and will also receive the same punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
