| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] starts to pace around [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], trying to get a better view and figure out who they are, not caring that this made [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] a [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] uncomfortable. Carrying on, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains that they don't know how they got here but would love to tag along with the group until they can figure out what is happening. The group agrees, but not before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] cattily says, "Oh, and I bet you want to go to a library to learn it as well" " referencing Chenri's usual solution to these sorts of problems. Without missing a beat, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains either a library or a guide will do. Looking off into the distance, they can see a small plume of black smoke rising up from behind some hills in the direction of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that if [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] was on an airship that crashed, then it would make sense that the black smoke might be from that. "Unless they're lying", [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] added quietly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are all getting into the carriage, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asks [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] where they are originally from, and after a thing, they explain they are from a small island town called [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] in [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], a nation none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever adventured to or heard of. Before the carriage starts to move, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is told in no uncertain terms that they are not to touch anything, especially any old books or notes (Referring to Chenris' notes and items). [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] promises they won't. It was about a half-a-day journey from what was [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], and the airship was a few hours from the town. Along the way, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asks why they don't think they're part of the fey when they have the features of one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | An hour after [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], they all reach the remaining frame of the airship, with parts still on fire and a shattered crystal found in the centre of the wreckage. On the walls that hadn't burnt down, the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] logo could be seen, immediately raising suspicions of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]. While investigating, Aidan is able to confirm that the ship is not the same one from earlier in their adventure. Upon seeing the dead bodies, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] goes incredibly quiet as he tries to hold back his panic. They all begin to edge close ([[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] less so) to try and learn more from the wreckage. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] takes this time to analyse the magic around the ship and learns that there are faint traces of strange magical energy, information [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] instantly links to the large wave of magic that spread out from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] after [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] 's work. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also realises that that crystal absolutely shouldn't have shattered since they're quite durable and important to keeping the airship in the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | Looking at the airship in more detail, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] starts to remember weird visions of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|cults]] and needing to save people. Once hearing this, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] immediately comes up with a theory that maybe the crystal chatting from the magic of magic wave could have caused Chenris' and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's memories to somehow fuse together, explaining the weird pockets of knowledge they have. Throughout this whole process, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] is notably hesitant to call Chenris by name, referring to them as 'you know' or 'the old man'. With little to garner from the wreckage, they decided to head back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]] since it was getting late. Before getting back into his carriage, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] took one last good luck at the scene, but more importantly, he was also looking for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] had some questions for the man, and he was angry he hadn't gotten them already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | When heading back to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] tried to plan what to do next, but the decision eventually broke down as neither [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] nor [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] could decide as they kept thinking about how Chenris would have loved to go to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]] and if he couldn't go then what was the point? Eventually, they decided to go to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] since that's where all clues were leading, so they felt obligated to go. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tried to cut the tension by saying, "If it helps, I would also find [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]] fascinating", with a smile, it was not well received, with [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] even mocking them. Still feeling quite hot-headed, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] snarkily asked what they could even do. Not to be deterred, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly explains that they love magic, researching and tinkering with things. Upon hearing these, they begrudgingly invite [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] to join them until they can figure out what is going on. Before [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] could accept, they heard a voice speak in their head, telling them to join the group. They immediately start looking around to try and find the source of the voice but failed to do so, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] makes a comment on how they look like they're on drugs. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | They stopped to rest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]]; everyone flashed their [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] tattoos at the front desk to gain entry until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed he didn't have any such tattoo. The receptionist flatly tells them that the fee is 50 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]] - Money [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] did not have. Aidan and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] offered to pay the fee, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] thanked them deeply and offered up the three pieces of [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] he owned for the payment. With the fee paid, they all get a good night's sleep. The next morning, while eating breakfast, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] gathers everyone but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] for a huddle ([[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] doesn't notice at all), and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] states that there are a lot of parallels between chenris and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and they should test him by making him do the directions. They call [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and ask if they could navigate them to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]]. When he asked, he suddenly remembered that he was mapping when the purple light hit and caused the ship to crash. He explained his hesitation but eventually said they'd, do it. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] navigates the next leg of their journey perfectly causing most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] a lot of confusion.                                                                                                                         |
