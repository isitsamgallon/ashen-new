| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] told [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], after their prayer, that the most interesting thing in the area is an old dravern settlement called [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]] and explained how it came up in a few history books [^5] and might hold something interesting. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] soon all agreed, and they set off for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]].                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | They soon reached [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]]. It was an old-fashioned mining town swarmed with Automatons similar to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suddenly felt very nostalgic again and immediately approached one and said hi. The Automaton outputted an error. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then tried to say hi in ancient Dwarvish. The Automaton immediately looked their way and asked if the fighting would soon continue. |
