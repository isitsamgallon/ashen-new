| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 51\|Session 51]]    | What finally convinced everyone was that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested taking the many golems they found in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]] to help with the attack, using them as a distraction while they took out the leadership. If everyone loaded onto an airship, they could then drop in for a surprise attack. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew the [[Admin/Spells/Fly\|fly]] spell would mean they could easily slip in without making a sound or taking any damage from jumping from an airship. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] thought it was a great idea, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was less excited but thought the plan was sound. |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] told [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], after their prayer, that the most interesting thing in the area is an old dravern settlement called [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]] and explained how it came up in a few history books [^5] and might hold something interesting. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] soon all agreed, and they set off for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | They soon reached [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]]. It was an old-fashioned mining town swarmed with Automatons similar to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suddenly felt very nostalgic again and immediately approached one and said hi. The Automaton outputted an error. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then tried to say hi in ancient Dwarvish. The Automaton immediately looked their way and asked if the fighting would soon continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
