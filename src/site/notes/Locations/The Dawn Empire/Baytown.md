| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | They all decided that their best bet would be to go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]] and hire a boat to cross the waters to the island. There was briefly a discussion to go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], who could probably just teleport them there, but it was deemed too much of a risk to make the long journey back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to find he couldn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | They stopped to rest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Rosehost\|Rosehost]]; everyone flashed their [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]] tattoos at the front desk to gain entry until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed he didn't have any such tattoo. The receptionist flatly tells them that the fee is 50 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]] - Money [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] did not have. Aidan and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] offered to pay the fee, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] thanked them deeply and offered up the three pieces of [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] he owned for the payment. With the fee paid, they all get a good night's sleep. The next morning, while eating breakfast, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] gathers everyone but [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] for a huddle ([[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] doesn't notice at all), and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] states that there are a lot of parallels between chenris and [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and they should test him by making him do the directions. They call [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and ask if they could navigate them to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]]. When he asked, he suddenly remembered that he was mapping when the purple light hit and caused the ship to crash. He explained his hesitation but eventually said they'd, do it. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] navigates the next leg of their journey perfectly causing most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] a lot of confusion. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]] | Arriving at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], they are confronted with a small fishing village comprised mostly of hearty sailors, and the stench of fresh fish clouds the air. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] approaches. The person they deem to have the best vibe and strikes up a conversation. It's an incredibly gruff sailor who greets them well enough. Getting straight to the point, they ask if the sailor could take them to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]], he says he can, but it would cost them. The sailor says that it's a long journey, plus they would need a return trip, and he would need to get supplies. All in, it would cost them 1000 [[Other Information/Gold\|Gold]]. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to haggle the price when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] stepped up and offered to pay the fee, handing over 100 Platinum to the sailor. She explained that she was feeling quite bad for not helping out as much, and it was the least she could do for the people who have been so good to her. They all thank her, and the sailor points to his boat, a smaller wooden ship that doesn't even have an inside or lower deck, but there was enough space for some bed rolls and to eat.                                                |
