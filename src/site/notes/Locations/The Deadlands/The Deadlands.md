| [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | Along the way, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] revealed that he was a native of [[Locations/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]], and an excited [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if he knew of Name Poisons, as they had recently come across one that killed someone named [[Named Characters & Beasts/Dave McDuffin †\|Dave McDuffin †]]. Unfortunately, [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was familiar with Name Positions but not with any of the details surrounding them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | Examining the arrow, [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] couldn't identify the poison but noticed that the name "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Dave McDuffin †\|Dave McDuffin †]]" was engraved on the shaft. Sensing some magic on the arrow, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over the analysis. However, they could only determine that it was enchanted. CXhenris, on the other hand, immediately recognised it from an old class at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] as a "Name Poison," a technique from [[Locations/The Deadlands/The Deadlands\|The Deadlands]] that creates especially deadly poisons targeted at a specific person. The arrow would not affect anyone else and could not be replicated. Chenris shared this knowledge with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who explained it to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], much to their surprise. |
