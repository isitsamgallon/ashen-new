### Overview
 Notable Information An old Tomb found deep with in the mines of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]] that held the body of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]]. It was a prototype of a time machine that was used to save a the Dwarven nobility during the final days of the [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] uprising. Unfortunately the room lost the section that could warp time but the section that could teleport is still functional. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] seems to be the only one who can pilot the room but seems to be more than happy to teleport where party needs to go  when needed

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 46\|Session 46]] | They all decided it was best to travel to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] before continuing their journey. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] began planning the route. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suddenly had a thought, grabbed the device that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] had given them, and clicked the button. Soon, the [[Locations/Ancient Dwarven Tomb\|Ancient Dwarven Tomb]] appeared before them, and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim]] greeted them politely in one of his many bodies. [[The Party/Viktor Malkovich\|Viktor]] was incredibly confused as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim]] quickly caught him up to speed. |
