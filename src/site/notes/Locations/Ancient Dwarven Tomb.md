### Overview
 Notable Information An old Tomb found deep with in the mines of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]] that held the body of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]]. It used to be a part of the time machine that was sued to save a lot of the Dwarven nobility during the final days of the [[Other Information/Races/Human\|human]] uprising. Unfortunately the room lost the section that could warp time but the section that could teleport is still functional. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ruldrim Thunderroot\|Ruldrim Thunderroot]] seems to be the only one who can pilot the room but seems to be more than happy to teleport where party needs to go  when needed
