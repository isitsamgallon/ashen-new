Inside the family is currently building the familiar house. The Dawn expanded their empire and the family moved from their house in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. They got here by being smuggled in with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Red Beard\|Captain Red Beard]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Their quest for the ritual pages took them repeatedly into [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], each time arriving at a clearing with a house in various stages of decay. Each mission brought them closer to the house's original state, revealing more of its history and its occupants’ tragic past. On their second-to-last mission, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] encountered a man building a home alongside his pregnant wife and child. The man recounted a harrowing tale of leaving [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] and making a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] to survive a treacherous sea journey. In exchange for safe passage, the god claimed their second-born child, an act that still haunted the family. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] acquired the page but left in stunned silence, burdened by the cruelty of the god and the suffering he inflicted. |
