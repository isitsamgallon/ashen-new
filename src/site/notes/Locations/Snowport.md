### Overview
A city ruled by [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]]. Known for being chaotic and a harsh place to live. The first was mentioned near the start of the campaign in [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] as a potential way to get out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]].

| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]]          | Walking back to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] took some time as [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] got into a vicious snowball fight, which became very one-sided when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] realised that their cloak could be used to melt the snowballs before they could hit them. What they didn't think of was all of the water that would now be falling on them from the melted snow. The whole ordeal made [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] howl with laughter as an embarrassed [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stormed ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]]          | "Still..." [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|the Hunter]] pondered, "Strange to see them come so close to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]..." His thoughts trailed off as he rubbed his chin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 53\|Session 53]]          | While he stewed, [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] approached the bartender to ask if he had any rooms available for the night. The bartender was confused and asked why he would have rooms for rent. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] tried to explain that many taverns offered rooms for rent to tourists. Their voice trailing off as they realised how strange a nation [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] must be to have tourism. Sighing deeply, the bartender said that they were more than welcome to sleep on the floor if they wanted somewhere warm to stay for the night. Having slept in worse [[Other Information/Rules & Reference/Conditions\|conditions]], they both happily accepted and returned to the group.                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 52\|Session 52]]          | Using their hand to block the sun's rays, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] surveyed the scene before coming across a familiar face, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lil Boat Boy\|Lil Boat Boy]], the sailor who took them to [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone]][^1]. After pointing the man out, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] went over to say hi, and after a brief exchange and many introductions, the sailor agreed to take them to [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 52\|Session 52]]          | They soon touched down in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]], a relatively small town with only a few general stores, a [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]], and a tavern or two to break up the monotony of the dilapidated houses. While [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] checked out the Tavern to see if they had any rooms available $_{and to see what Ales they had}$, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|mordecai]] ventured into the [[Groups & Factions/Halos Emporium\|Halos Emporium]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was hoping to pick up a Spell Scroll of Silence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 52\|Session 52]]          | With [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] so cut off from the rest of the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]], all prices were much higher than [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had expected. They tried to bargain with the shopkeeper, but the Halfing stood steadfast in his pricing. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly called after [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] to see if they could work their magic. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]], unusually flustered from being put on the spot, said that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was mentally challenged, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was their career. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] had been tasked with getting the scroll to help build their confidence.                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 52\|Session 52]]          | Approaching one of the hunters, he asked if they could tell him about navigating through the forests around [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Ringo\|The Hunter]] explained that if you wanted to travel, there were two options: walk along the coast and risk being robbed by [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|the golden fleet]], or walk through the forest. However, without a knowledgeable guide, they wouldn't last more than a day before they got lost and died, or were 'attacked by the...wildlife'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/07 Winter Warriors/Session 52\|Session 52]]          | "[[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] is going to be fun", said [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] coyly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]] | The party escapes The Not World and heads east to the last page where they find the house and the not world. Inside the family is currently building the familiar house. The Dawn expanded their empire and the family moved from their house in [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. They got here by being smuggled in with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Red Beard\|Captain Red Beard]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Their quest for the ritual pages took them repeatedly into [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], each time arriving at a clearing with a house in various stages of decay. Each mission brought them closer to the house's original state, revealing more of its history and its occupants’ tragic past. On their second-to-last mission, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] encountered a man building a home alongside his pregnant wife and child. The man recounted a harrowing tale of leaving [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] and making a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] to survive a treacherous sea journey. In exchange for safe passage, the god claimed their second-born child, an act that still haunted the family. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] acquired the page but left in stunned silence, burdened by the cruelty of the god and the suffering he inflicted. |
