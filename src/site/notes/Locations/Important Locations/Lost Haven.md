### Overview
Nation found to the North East of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and home to one of [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. So far not much is known about this place except that it is ruled over by a tyrant king. There is very clear class divide within people, similar to the [Cast System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India).  [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] seems to hate the nation due to a rebellion that almost won in the city.

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] also revealed to [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] that  Kal 'got a bunch of people killed' in Lost Haven.

The capital has a large library

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]     | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]". |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]     | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] found a nearby table, set a map on it, and said they should plan out their route for the foreseeable future. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] says that he wants [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] since they need to sort out everything there and then end up near [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] as [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is becoming impatient with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 26\|Session 26]]     | Most take the travel time to get some rest and heal up. Once [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] woke up, they immediately got out a piece of paper and started to write a letter but kept the details a secret from the rest of the group. Intrigued, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] asks what he is writing, which [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] says is none of their business. Turning very serious, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] explains that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] needs to be able to trust each other completely. He had already explained his secrets to [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], and it feels especially important now that their friend has died. He notably struggled with his emotions as he said the word friend. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs before explaining that he wants to start tying up loose ends and is writing a letter to his father. Having not heard much about [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s father, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] tentatively asks if he is on good terms with his father, but [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] remains tight-lipped about any details with his family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]] | When weighing up their options, Mordecai says, that whatever they do he can stay with Aidan and cast [Dispel Magic]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) If and when needed. Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]] | Korrigan, feeling a bit lost and defeated, says that the party needs to trust each other and and to do that we need everything on the table. He starts to explain his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. She brought him back to life so he could settle his business in [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] and make sure the tower in there falls. The party is stunned into silence. Chenris without looking up replies "i'll take first watch"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
