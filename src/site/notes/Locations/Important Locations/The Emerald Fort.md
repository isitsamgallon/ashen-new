| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], and other strong warriors, like [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] is fractured, and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] is without a leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] mentions that they should probably drop off [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] before she is gone for too long. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] wants to check on [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], while [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] wants to check up on [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yokotori\|Yokotori]]. After checking a few things, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] declares that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] is currently docked south of [[Locations/OFC/Twopines Estate\|Twopines Estate]], so it might be worth going there as they might have some more information. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] jokingly dubs this the [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] plan, and they quietly cheer for their new plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | Soon the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] catches up and asks what's going on. Drache introduces the man as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]], his best friend in the fort before he left. They also explain that they call Drache Stumpy because he is one of the smallest in the fort. Everyone found this incredibly hard to believe with how their friend is - easily towering over most of the people they've met on their journey so far. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] then notices Drache's missing leg and states it will be quite a shock to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] but he's sure that won't matter in the end. Mordecai asks what types of people typically work at the fort so he could start working on a disguise. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]] explains that there are a lot of half-orcs and many of the other races. "They ain't too picky as long as you can fight and will obey [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|the boss]]" explains [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Olgrik †\|Olgrik †]]. Drache admits they don't treat people well at Tulan, unlike in [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. Mordecai explains that he has some spells that he can use to disguise himself, the half-orc laughs stating he'll need to put on a lot of muscle to fit in around the fort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | With their preparations made, Drache opens the bookcase and steps out into the familiar storage room of the fort, mostly filled with boxes of rations. They hope that most should be asleep, allowing them to move through the fort without encountering many people. They quietly open the door and are confronted with an empty courtyard with a fountain. They take a right and along a path, they encounter a heavy wooden door, Drache explains this is the throne room, and they will have to be as quiet as possible in there or be spotted and tortured. Putting an ear to the door they can hear a man snoring. Drache, assuming it is Damascus, explains that he is a light sleeper so be careful as they all sneak in. Klyn is asleep on his throne, there are many knick-knacks strewn about the place as well as various notes, maps and journals.  As they are passing through Chenris garners at the maps to see if they hold any useful information. The maps have most major cities marked, and highlight where Tulan troops patrol. It seems they never go beyond [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] to the south, and keep a wide birth from [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 15\|Session 15]] | Drache and Mordecai take the first watch. While on watch, they could hear someone singing a song about the 1000 year reign of the Dawn. Mordecai and Drache talk about how Drache has a lot of anxiety around going back to [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] - bonding moment. In the next watch, Chenris and Aidan find horses and Aidan is able to tame of the horses. in the next watch Kal sees a man in white robe. the robes an emblem of a bird with a crest and banner on it ([[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]). This leaves Chenris white with worry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 14\|Session 14]] | Korrigan, ever the propionate of free will, is left to stew in his frustration over being forced to do something against his will. That and the ongoing frustration of not knowing who the trait of the group is, springs to action. Interrupting the group's strategy meeting, he declares he knows how to find the betrayer in their ranks and uses his fey pact to summon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] to his aid. Upon realising what is happening Merek starts to profusely sweat with worry and fear and timidly asks what is required of him. With a manic laugh, he tells Merek that if he uncovers who is responsible for failing the ritual and not banishing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], then is free of his debt. Merek is frozen in fear before being hurried off to do his job. Satisfied with the results of his actions he turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asks what preparation for the war need to be done. A moment of hesitation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] gets back to explaining the the dire situation the OFC is in. Even with [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] troupes, they are still out numbered at least 5 to 1. The Dawn has more airships, warships and heavy duty weaponry at their disposal as well. She also makes note that even though the OFC does have access to ships and airships, these are all small and/or merchant vessels meaning if they are all lost then their nation will be crippled in their trade capabilities after the war, even if they were to win. |

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The group regrouped near [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] ’s teleportation hub, their next destination [[Locations/Important Locations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. The hub was a grand hall filled with travellers and bustling attendants. A blue-scaled kobold manned the reception desk, efficiently arranging their passage and handing them a slip with their room number and departure time. With an hour to spare, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] dispersed to explore. Korrigan, drawn to a coffee shop run by a golden-scaled dragon, convinced Mordecai to join him for tea. However, the cost of their drinks—fifty [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] —left Korrigan floundering. Mordecai, with a resigned sigh, unclasped his golden chain and offered it as payment.
