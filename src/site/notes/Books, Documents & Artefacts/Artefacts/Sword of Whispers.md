### Overview
First mentioned by [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] as something that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] had long lost and spent most of its time trying to recover. It is said to be a powerful weapon. It was latter revealed in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]] that this was another name for [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]].
