# Origins
The story goes that there was once a very powerful wizard who lived in a tower in a far-off land. He had accomplished a lot in his time but was unsatisfied since he was not able to learn everything about the world before he died. [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], eager for some entertainment, approached the man and made a deal with him: if he performed a scarifies to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], then he would create an artefact that would extend his life tenfold. The man agrees and sacrifices an untold amount of lives until God is happy and creates the amulet. However, [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] cursed the amulet to kill the wearer through freak accidents. One day, the creator was walking along a stream and tripped on a stone fell into the stream and drowned. 

Since then, many people have tried wearing the amulet to receive its magical benefits but have all died in freak accidents. Until curiously, someone decided to take on the curse by themselves, leaving the amulet with just its benefits.
