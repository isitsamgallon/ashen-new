### Overview
A crumpled-up piece of paper that contains the last problem [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] wanted to solve before his death. He passed it on to [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] at the moment of his death and his last wish. 

### Other Information & History
- Chenris was meant to burn it as a part of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]] but kept the real one to himself, ultimately making the whole ritual fail.
- After the events of [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]], [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] temporarily held on to the note as none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] trusted Chenris with it. Additionally, it served as a great way to control Chenris, who was getting increasingly out of control. 
- The note was eventually returned in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] as a symbol that Mordecai trusted Chenris again.
- The note was last seen in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/The Dawnhaven Crypts\|The Dawnhaven Crypts]] when Chenris burnt it after sacrificing himself to save [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].
