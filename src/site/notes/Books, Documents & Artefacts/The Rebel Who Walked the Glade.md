Once, in a moment between life and death, a mortal awoke to a realm unlike any other. He was The Revolutionary of Promises, a man tethered to an unfulfilled vow. Gasping for breath, he sat upright, his heart pounding as his eyes widened at the kaleidoscopic chaos surrounding him.

The land was a tapestry of unearthly beauty and madness. Fields stretched endlessly, their grasses glowing in shades of electric blue and violet, swaying to an inaudible tune. Trees with gnarled trunks spiralled skyward, their branches adorned with blossoms that pulsed softly with inner light. Flickering orbs of brilliance flitted through the air, trailing shimmering stardust in their wake.

Strange beings roamed freely: butterflies the size of shields, their iridescent wings catching the light like stained glass; goat-like creatures with glittering coats and eyes alight with mischief, bleating in laughter as they pranced through the fantastical scenery.

In the distance, a river of liquid silver wound its way through the vibrant terrain, reflecting the dreamlike skies above. Translucent fish leapt from the shimmering water, twisting in elegant arcs before vanishing back into the depths. The Revolutionary stood, overcome by wonder yet unnerved by the intoxicating energy thrumming through the land, an energy that seemed to creep into his very bones.

From behind a cluster of towering mushrooms glowing green and violet, a silhouette emerged. The figure stepped forward, framed against the dazzling horizon, their presence commanding and otherworldly.

The figure possessed wings that shimmered like the midnight sky, their silver and gold feathers shifting as if alive. Her form exuded grace and danger, her gaze piercing as she studied The Revolutionary. He felt her eyes on him like a weight, and for a moment, the enchantment of the realm became suffocating.

Clearing his throat, he spoke, masking his fear with a veneer of confidence. "Uh… am I dead? This doesn’t look much like the afterlife I’ve heard about."

The Winged Sovereign stepped closer, her voice melodic yet sharp, carrying the faintest lilt of amusement. "You are dead, Wanderer," she said, her gaze never wavering. "And so too is the promise you made… unless you make a deal with me."

She spread her arms, her wings catching the faint glow of the ethereal blossoms as she gestured to the vivid chaos around them. "I am the Sovereign of Splintered Dreams, ruler of the Eternal Glade."

The Revolutionary blinked, his breath catching in his chest. "What kind of deal?" he asked cautiously. "What could I possibly offer to a deity?"

The Sovereign’s lips curled into a smile, equal parts inviting and dangerous. "What I offer is simple. I will bring you back to the mortal plane. I will grant you magic unlike any you’ve known—power enough to fulfil your promise, to finish what you started. In return…"

She took a step closer, her smile sharpening. "You will be my Messenger. You will walk among mortals as one of my own, a piece of the Glade brought to life. And," she added with a whisper, her voice brushing his mind like a forbidden melody, "when the time comes, you will shatter their shield of arrogance"

The Revolutionary stiffened, unease gnawing at the edges of his thoughts. "Shatter the shield? Why?"

The Sovereign gave a shrug, her tone light but laced with mischief. "For entertainment. The world has become so predictable, hasn’t it? I crave something… unexpected."

She began to pace around him, the vibrant energy of the Glade swirling with her every step. "You’ll have a home here," she purred. "You’ll be one of my people, bound to my court. Your memories of your past will fade for a time, but when you return to the mortal plane, mere hours will have passed for your friends."

Her offer hung in the air, sweet and treacherous as poisoned honey. "So," she said, her eyes glinting, "what do you say, Revolutionary?"

The Revolutionary hesitated, torn between his lingering humanity and the intoxicating pull of the Sovereign's domain. Her realm called to him and whispered promises of freedom and power that ignited something deep within his soul. At last, his resolve hardened. He extended his hand. "I accept."

The Sovereign’s smile widened, her eyes gleaming as she clasped his hand in hers. A fiery purple aura ignited at her touch, racing up his arm and engulfing him. His body began to dissolve, the sensation not of pain but of a cold, eerie numbness. His flesh seemed to peel away, replaced by something foreign, something wild.

A burning itch bloomed on his forehead, intensifying into an almost maddening sensation. His vision blurred, and shadows crept into the edges of his sight. The world around him spun the vibrant chaos of the Glade warping into a whirlpool of light and sound.

Through the haze, the last thing he saw was the Sovereign's radiant smile, warm and triumphant.

“See you soon, Messenger,” she whispered, her voice like velvet thunder.

The void swallowed him whole.
