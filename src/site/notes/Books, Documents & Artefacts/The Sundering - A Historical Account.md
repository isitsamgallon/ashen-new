The Sundering stands as one of the most cataclysmic events in the annals of history, a period of chaos and devastation that ushered in the Seventh Era. Over the course of three harrowing years, the world was irrevocably transformed by the machinations of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] and their dark deity, [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], the Cleansing Flame, Destroyer of Worlds.

It began with [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]]’s audacious plan to harness the power of the mighty volcano, [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]]. Their objective was to shatter the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], a mystical barrier that separated the gods from the mortal realm. The [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], held together by ancient pillars and weak magical crystals, was vulnerable. The cult's sinister goal was to summon [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] into the world, believing that his fiery wrath would cleanse the land, leaving them as its new rulers.

Once the cult succeeded in breaching the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] descended upon the mortal realm, and the world was plunged into a fiery nightmare. The cultists, who had long worshiped [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], welcomed their transformation into [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]]—zombie-like beings formed from their own ashes. They believed this transformation granted them immortality, as [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] did not age or succumb to disease.

For the first year, [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] and his newly formed [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army remained at [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], consolidating their power. They raided villages across [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]], converting the slain into more [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] and crafting powerful weapons from the molten minerals beneath the volcano. Among these was the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]], a fearsome weapon imbued with dark magic that could turn enemies into [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] upon contact.

As the second year dawned, the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army expanded its territory, capturing forts and towns across [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. They halted at the [[Locations/Verdant Peninsula\|Verdant Peninsula]], recognizing that their forces were not yet prepared to confront the formidable Dawn Empire and the elven kingdom of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. Instead, they fortified their positions and armed their troops, a decision later deemed a strategic error, as [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] of defenders was initially unprepared for the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] threat.

[[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]], formed in the latter half of the second year, was a monumental alliance between major factions, including [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] Empire, mercenary bands from the Tulan and Emerald Forts, the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]], and the magical university of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. This unprecedented unity brought together humans and [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]], commanded by some of the realm's most brilliant leaders: Emperor [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]], General [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] of [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]], and Empress [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]] of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]].

Their first encounter with the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army, led by the cunning [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], was disastrous. Seifer's strategic genius led to the annihilation of a large coalition force through a devastating sacrificial explosion, decimating [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]]'s morale and numbers.

[[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], sensing the surge of power from Seifer’s sacrifice, swiftly moved to the battlefield, where he resurrected the fallen coalition soldiers as new [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]]. [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] faced continuous setbacks as the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]]'s numbers grew with each battle, and the situation worsened with internal treachery.

[[Groups & Factions/The Goblin Resistance\|The Goblin Resistance]], led by General [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]], betrayed [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] in hopes of currying favor with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]]’s act of devotion, sacrificing his own son to become an [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]], marked a turning point. The goblins disrupted coalition supply lines and defenses, leading to the collapse of several key cities and the fall of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] Empire’s territories.

As [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] forces dwindled, [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] prepared for a decisive strike. The siege of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] Empire’s capital, was [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]]'s last stand. For four grueling months, the defenders held out against the relentless [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]]. In a final desperate move, the remaining heroes launched a counterattack, carving a path through the enemy to confront [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] himself.

The battle against [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] was fierce and legendary. Despite their valor, [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] heroes were no match for the god's might. However, through a clever ruse orchestrated by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]], they created an opening. Galen, possibly aided by divine intervention or sheer heroism, struck a mortal blow to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], piercing his heart and decapitating him. With [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s physical form destroyed, the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] disintegrated, and their souls were freed.

[[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]’s parting words were a dire warning: "You may have killed this physical form, but I will be back. Mark my words, you cannot kill a GOD." Yet, in that moment, [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] had achieved a miraculous victory, bringing an end to the Sundering and paving the way for the Seventh Era.

The tale of the Sundering serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the enduring hope that even in the darkest times, unity and courage can triumph over chaos and destruction.
