A book that [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] secretly read while [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was in [[Locations/Strixhavem/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. He was looking for information about [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] and how they function. This was mostly likely because of his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. Here is a summary of the book, taken from [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Ashen Book\|The Ashen Book]]:

### The Book
The text began with the story of The Primordial Divinity, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]—[[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|The All-Father]], who existed before all else. It spoke of how, upon his death, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]'s soul fractured, fragments of his soul manifested as gods, born from his emotions—Anger, Sadness, Hatred, Compassion, and many more—forming a pantheon that ruled over the realms.

[[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]'s body fractured into countless eggs, each one hatching into vast and powerful beings. To shield themselves from the divine, these beings encased themselves within shells, crafting the very planets upon which life would flourish.

The planet upon which [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] journeyed had one of these beings at its core—a creature known as [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]], a monstrous entity whose vast tentacles had been lured into the towering pillars that now held it captive. These Divine Pillars, ancient and mysterious, drained the creature’s power, syphoning its energy to maintain a precarious balance, binding [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] to its prison and warding off the wrath of the gods. The book explains that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]’s very being repels the gods and suppresses their power, [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] amplify that power to create a barrier to protect the mortal world from the gods.

[[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]] could be freed by severing the magical link that connected [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] to [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]]
