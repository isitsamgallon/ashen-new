### Overview
When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] were walking through [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] in [[Session Notes/04 Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]], they overheard a group of people meeting in the town hall, where I, dressed in red robes, appeared and started to talk about how they wanted to go back to the old ways. When they left, they handed out these flyers which read, "Remember, remember the prince of fire" 

The party grabbed one after the meeting had ended so they would have something to remember the man by.
