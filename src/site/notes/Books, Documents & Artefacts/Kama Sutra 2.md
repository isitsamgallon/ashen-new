The Kama Sutra is an ancient Indian Hindu Sanskrit text on sexuality, eroticism and emotional fulfilment. Attributed to Vātsyāyana, the Kamasutra is neither exclusively nor predominantly a sex manual on sex position, but rather a guide on the art of living well, the nature of love, finding partners, maintaining sex life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties. It is a sutra genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different commentaries. The text is a mix of prose and anustubh meter poetry verses.
