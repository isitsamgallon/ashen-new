It has come to my attention (again) that reanimated skeletons are being left to wander the halls, chambers, and occasionally the pantry after their tasks are complete. This is unacceptable. While we pride ourselves on our necromantic mastery, leaving discarded constructs lying about is both a safety hazard and a breach of basic sanctum etiquette. Do I need to remind you of the incident with Apprentice Maldin and the "unwashed custodian" skeleton last month? Effective immediately:

1. **Decommissioning:** All skeletons must be properly dismissed or returned to their storage alcoves after use.
2. **Sanitation:** Any remnants—bones, dust, or arcane residue—must be cleaned up. The undead do not tidy themselves, as much as we might wish otherwise.
3. **Reporting Damage:** If a skeleton is damaged beyond usability, report it to Archivist Tharil for cataloguing and disposal. Do _not_ leave pieces lying about for others to trip over.
4. **Pantry Protocol:** No skeletons near the food stores. Ever.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in your summoning privileges being temporarily revoked. Remember, we are necromancers, not slobs. For the continued harmony of our sanctum,
