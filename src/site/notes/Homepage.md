| [[Session Notes/06 Urban Legends/Session 49\|Session 49]]    | 6th Saga - Urban Legends   | The party grappled with the OFC’s fragile finances, turning to the Tome of Unfinished Stories to conjure wealth, only to attract dangerous visitors.

Essentially [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Malachi Darkthorne †\|Malachi Darkthorne †]] had reengineered [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Tower]] to force all magic in the affect area to go through it rather than  just straight from [[Locations/The Realm of Mana\|The Realm of Mana]] to the material plane. He could then hook into [[Other Information/The Towers\|the tower]] and control which spell happened and what didn't. this is also how he was able to hear [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] speak while they were turned into [[gold\|gold]] as he could understand all magical communication happening within [[Other Information/The Towers\|the tower]]'s reach. |

### Other Information 
Most tables are actually database query searches and will automatically update when new information is added. DM [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] if you have any suggestions on possible searches.

As always, you should talk to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] if you have any ideas or thoughts relating to the campaign. **NEVER** keep secrets from the DM. This is a collaborative storytelling game, and it only works well if the storyteller knows what's happening. They might even be able to make it happen better than you expected.
