| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] | Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons | The party uncovered grim truths about the desert’s armies, recruited an old friend, and accidentally incited a workers' revolt at Tulan Fort.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]] | Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons | Aiden endured a series of psychological trials, reliving his past, facing judgment for his crimes, and rejecting an illusion of a better life to reaffirm his loyalty to his companions.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]] | Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons | The Party navigated absurd chaos, from Korrigan’s accidental demon marriage to Halfbie’s existential crisis over a fake terminal illness.

### Other Information 
Most tables are actually database query searches and will automatically update when new information is added. DM [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] if you have any suggestions on possible searches.

As always, you should talk to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] if you have any ideas or thoughts relating to the campaign. **NEVER** keep secrets from the DM. This is a collaborative storytelling game, and it only works well if the storyteller knows what's happening. They might even be able to make it happen better than you expected.
