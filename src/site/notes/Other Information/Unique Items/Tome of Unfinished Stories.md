| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 41\|Session 41]] | While the others had a moment of silence, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly got out the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and wrote in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]]'s name. Ink slowly seeped into the ancient pages before being replaced with text that read, 'When [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] died, she was 334'. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] saw [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] reading the book and peeked at the page before becoming amazed at how long [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] had been alive. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] nodded, saying that it had alluded them for a while now. A few of the [[Other Information/Races/Human\|humans]] involved in [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]] were hundreds of years old, even though they were only [[Other Information/Races/Human\|human]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] revealed in their notes that they had been calling these people Perpetuals. So far, they had listed Galen Verik, Caden Steelbreaker and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve]] as all pertutals, with only Galen having a somewhat concrete explanation [^2]. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], still on the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] with her giant ice spider, hurried to escape from [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|the Tulan Fort]]. They could hear shouts and screams from within the fort as they rushed to raid for the chaise. While [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] panicked and attempted to devise a plan to get out of this situation, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly took out their [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and began casting a spell to rewrite aspects of the world. The spell changed the problem so that the people in the fort were no longer angry with them and were willing to offer a choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
