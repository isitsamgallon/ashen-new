| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], still on the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sylva Riverstone\|Sylva]] with her giant ice spider, hurried to escape from [[Locations/Important Locations/The Tulan Fort\|the Tulan Fort]]. They could hear shouts and screams from within the fort as they rushed to raid for the chaise. While [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] panicked and attempted to devise a plan to get out of this situation, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly took out their [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories]] and began casting a spell to rewrite aspects of the world. The spell changed the problem so that the people in the fort were no longer angry with them and were willing to offer a choice. |
