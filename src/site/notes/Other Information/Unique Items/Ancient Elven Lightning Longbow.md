### Overview
A powerful bow that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] bought from and [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] blacksmith. He bought it by going 1000s of [[Other Information/Credits\|Credits]] in debt.  

### Item Description
You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  3 times per day, the Archer can declare that they are casting the lightning bolt spell a level 3, instead of shooting an arrow.  When the Lightning bolt is cast a bolt of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw at DC 16. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. When the spell is used, the bow damage and base 1D8 damage is lost, and the enemy/target takes the full 8d6 damage just like the spell.
