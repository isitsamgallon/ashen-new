| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]] | Noticing that chenris is still seething, asks what happened. Chenris explains curtly everything about his soul and the deal he was offered for the same information but for him it would remove his memories of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]]. Korrigan reminds the elf that when it comes down to it, its the memory that counts not the note itself. Calming down, Mordecai hesitantly asks if he would like to hold on to [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|the note]] from now on and after a long sigh he says yes. Korrigan joking ask for the magic words to which Chenris replies "Fuck off". Mordecai hands him the note with them both knowing this was a very big sign of trust. Korrigan also returns the Squirrel Staff. When Chenris grabs the staff, his vision shifts to show a [Mummy Lord](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16962-mummy-lord) picking up the squirrel, his eye flash as a wave physic damage washes over chenris as the Mummy lord crushes the squirrel and his vision returns. Suffering from a massive headache Chenris explains what he saws and surmises that they might need to deal with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]] sooner rather than later. Korrigan uses [Animal Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) to tell [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] what is happening and to come join them in the Pyramid for a fight. Mordecai asks if they should prepare and Chenris points out that his [[Other Information/Unique Items/Alchemy Jug\|Alchemy Jug]] has made 7 greater health potions. he would've been able to make more but they were often busy that he didn't have time empty the jog. He gives 3 to Mordecai, 1 to Aidan and 2 to Korrigan. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 12\|Session 12]] | The town [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had landed in was a coastal resort town call [[Locations/Ehobel/Yren\|Yren]]. They manage find a small show that sold potions and managed to barter a deal that Aidan would ages some wine in return for a health potion. Afterwards they move along with new potion (that chenris puts in his [[Other Information/Unique Items/Alchemy Jug\|Alchemy Jug]] to make infinite potions). As they're leaving the town, the gaurds warn them to never leave the paths since there are a lot of "Foul" things in the woods, especially at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
