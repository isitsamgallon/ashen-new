| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | As the cult summoned a time rift, Aiden worked frantically to close it while the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] launched an all-out assault. Overwhelmed by endless waves of cultists, their strength was nearly depleted when Aiden finally sealed the rift, its collapse leaving a grotesque scene of twisted bodies and blood-soaked stone. The group claimed a sinister dagger, Edge of the Onyx Sands, and Chenris uncovered a critical page for [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|the Black Ritual]], along with a staff of swarming insects. The ritual’s price—a burning of sacred pages and cherished possessions—left them grimly aware of the sacrifices ahead. Following the pull of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Pages\|the pages]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ventured into a dark forest that transported them to a decayed mansion of malevolent energy. |
