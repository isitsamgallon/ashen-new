| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Once the cost is clear, Chenris berates Mordecai with [Vicious Mockery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/vicious-mockery ) for being attacked earlier, they complain since they were being controlled, Chenris doesn't care. Chenris suggest they should move on unless there are anymore God complexes that wished to be enacted on. Mordecai sits in the cart in silence remembering everything and realising he was technically in control but but someone was influencing him. Looking in a normal mirror he notes that he doesn't feel as beautiful as before the whole ordeal. After a short journey they arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]], Chenris opens it with ease to see a familiar dark passage that he lights up with is [[Other Information/Unique Items/Multitool\|Multitool]] for people without Darkvision. He teams up with Korrigan to have a zombie squirrel to scout ahead around corners for them, korrigsn using his abilities to see through the eyes of the squirrel. This turned out to be a great idea as around the next corridor was a [Mummy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16961-mummy) guarding the door to the next room. After confirming that this isn't the one with the golden staff that hurt Chenris earlier they move in to neutralise it. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] seems satisfied with this strategy saying that they might just be able to do this and win. Chenris sends a guard to tell Winterbor and Witherfeather to get in position. they then get on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/The Black Dragon\|The Black Dragon]] to be taken to the front lines to give a speech. after making their preparations [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] and Chenris go on to the platform ready for their speech. Chenris uses his [[Other Information/Unique Items/Multitool\|Multitool]] to create some atmospheric music to make the speech more inspiring. Mordecai's speech is so inspiring that all of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]'s forces are amped up and ready to take on such a daunting threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
