### Gold
The predominant currency system throughout the majority of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It breaks down as follows:
- Platinum = 10 Gold
- Gold = 10 Silver 
- Silver = 10 Copper

### Credits
The official currency of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. It manifests as a glowing purple tattoo on a person's body, typically on the upper arm. The Credit system is not transferable to Gold or other currencies. You must have access to a spell to be able to transfer currency for purchases. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] is the only member of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] with access to this spell. The Credit system also allows people to go into debt and even give loans to people. The tattoo is only visible when you're in [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] territory.
