Ancient devised used to keep the [[Gods & Heralds/Gods & Heralds\|Ashen Pantheon]] from interacting with our world. They were created by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] sometime after [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] when a meteor fell from the sky and created a massive creator under what is now [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]].

The Towers are all built with crystals, which are powered by the tentacles of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. These tentacles cause the beast/God great pain and slowly kill them. 

The Towers power something called [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], the name of the barrier keeping the Gods out.
