Sizes in D&D 5E are split into different size categories. However, it is highly unlikely that your character will be sorted into anything besides the first four, as the larger sizes are usually reserved for monsters and creatures.

The D&D size chart below shows how much space each character size, on average, takes up, which gives you a good idea of what you could be working with - depending on your character’s playable species.

| Size       | Space                  | Examples      |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Tiny       | 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft      | [[Other Information/Races/Gnomes\|Gnomes]]    |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft              | [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|Halflings]] |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft              | [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]]     |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft            | Ogre          |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft            | Fire giant    |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft, or larger | Kraken        |
