### Overview
Eladrin are a subrace of [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]] who adopted the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] as their home. After centuries of exposure to that plane's magic, they acquired supernatural abilities not seen on most of their kin from the [Prime Material plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Material_plane "Prime Material plane") and were effectively transformed into [[Other Information/Races/Fey\|fey]]. They are capable of changing their physical appearance and powers according to their mood, assuming characteristics of the seasons.

### Attitudes & Beliefs
Like their physical appearance and their powers, the impulsiveness and intensity of [[Other Information/Races/Fey\|fey]] eladrin caused them to wildly change their personality depending on the season to which their emotional state felt closest.
- Eladrin in the spring state were joyful and playful, fond of mischief and playing pranks on other creatures. They were often oblivious to the dangers of doing so.
- In the summer state, which they entered when angered, eladrin became aggressive, vindictive, and furious.
- In the autumn state, fey eladrin assumed the role of conciliators, eager to resolve conflicts and to promote peace. They were also more compassionate and ready to help others and to alleviate their suffering.
- In the winter state, eladrin became bitter and pensive. They often cried frozen tears and irradiated a feeling of gloom that could be felt like a cold wind.

Despite these variations, all fey eladrin shared many common traits, such as the respect for personal freedom, a great love for beauty and art, and a desire to surround themselves with beautiful objects.

### Abilities
Eladrin were capable of teleporting over small distances. In an effect similar to the [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|misty step]] spell, they could briefly step into the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and shorten travel distances between two points, effectively instantly traveling over distances of up to 30 feet (9.1 meters).[1] Some high [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]], through diligent study, could also learn to use the same abilities.[8]

The abilities that fey eladrin possessed were dependent on the season towards which they had the most affinity.
- Spring eladrin channeled the joy of the spring season to all creatures around them, rendering them temporarily friendly and reluctant to attack the eladrin. They were innately capable of casting a number of spells, including [[Admin/Spells/Charm Person\|charm person]], confusion, enthrall, hallucinatory terrain, Otto's irresistible dance, [[Admin/Spells/Suggestion\|suggestion]], and [[Admin/Spells/Tasha's Hideous Laughter\|Tasha's hideous laughter]].
- Summer eladrin invoked the fiery aggression of the summer season, instilling [[Admin/Spells/Fear\|fear]] to the hearts of all creatures in their proximity. Unlike eladrin of other seasons, they did not have an innate ability to cast spells, instead relying on their great speed and physical strength.
- Autumn eladrin called upon the feelings of sharing and goodwill from the autumn season, avoiding violence when possible and using their magic to heal and help. While in that state, they were capable of innately casting spells such as calm emotions, [[Admin/Spells/Cure Wounds\|cure wounds]], [[Admin/Spells/Greater Restoration\|greater restoration]], heal, [[Admin/Spells/Lesser Restoration\|lesser restoration]], raise dead, and sleep.
- Winter eladrin entered that state when distressed by sadness. They irradiated their melancholy, sapping the will to act from all creatures around them. They could innately cast spells such as cone of cold, fog cloud, gust of wind, and ice storm.
