### Overview
**Vampires** are a type of powerful and feared [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") that feed on humanoid blood.

### Attitudes & Beliefs
Vampires enjoyed finer things in unlife and engaged in decadent behavior, often sharing such habits with [liches](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lich "Lich"). A vampire was always a creature of evil. If they were not evil in life, they became so in undeath, whether they retained the memories of their mortal existence or not. Whatever attachments and affection they had towards things from their life, all were changed and corrupted by the transformation.
