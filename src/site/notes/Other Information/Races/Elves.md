### Overview
**Elves**, known in their own tongue as **Tel-quessir**, are a  number of closely related, long-lived races that excelled in [magic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") The come from the land of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and are commonly known for living lavish housing and their constant wars with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]].

### Attitudes & Beliefs
Elves are often depicted with superiority complex, often looking down on the other races and regarding them as savages and brutes. Their culture is often centred around the arts and beauty and go to great lengths to heighten the beauty around them and their own. 

Due to their extremely long lifespans, they have strange perceptions of time often seeing 50 years as just blip in their lives.  Because of this way of electing emperors shifted from voting to a succession. Typically when one emperor dies the next lord in line for the throne will take their place or if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|the emperor]] lives for more than 1000s year then they move to the next one. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] broke this rule by becoming the next empress after her mother, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]]. 

Elves notably make frequent use of slaves, most likely captured during wars and invasions. so much so that [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] has atleast 3 slave companies ([[Locations/Ehobel/Cyran Slave Company\|Cyran Slave Company]], [[Locations/Ehobel/Vulwin Slave Company\|Vulwin Slave Company]], [[Locations/Ehobel/Jassin Slave Company\|Jassin Slave Company]])

### History
Elves fought during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] as their armies contained great mages and warriors.

Elves and [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] have fought many time, with the most recent being [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] which took place a little bit before the campaign.

### Half-Elves
Half-Elves are special and are cases where an elf will have a child with a member of another races, typically human as they're more compatible. Typically most will die during child birth but there are a few cases of them making it through childbirth, however, most will have some form of disability. 

A great example of this is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] who's [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|mother]] was an elf and her [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|father]] was a human. Obeus has a weakened immune system and is at extreme risk of death due to even minor colds and flus. This is why she wasn't aloud to leave her palace in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]].
