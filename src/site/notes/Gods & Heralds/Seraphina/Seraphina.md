> "AND SERAPHINA MOVED AS LIGHT THROUGH broken glass, the Healer of Wounds and Restorer of the Forsaken. Her hands, anointed with celestial fire, knit together flesh and spirit; her song brought balm to the weary and peace to the tormented. Clad in the dawn 's embrace, she walks where sorrow dwells, and by her touch, the sick rise, the shattered are made whole, and the forgotten remember Jove."<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Seraphina is a calm and radiant presence whose touch restores what was broken, not with spectacle, but with quiet devotion. Clad in soft light and the scent of clean air after rain, she moves among the wounded and forgotten, healing not just bodies, but the burdens they
carry. She does not promise to fix all things - only that none will be left to suffer alone. In her presence, silence becomes sanctuary.

### General Information
Although there is no distinction between the moral standing of the deities, she often considered the closet to being a 'moral good' God. It seems she has temples in most major cities that can be used to access healing. 

Each of her temples has a [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]], which also acts as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], that provides all the healing for the people in place of Seraphina since she is unable to enter [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was revealed early on that Seraphina hates [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]].

### Divine Attributes
- Seraphina is the goddess of Compassion, Healing, Protection, Mercy, and Fate- a radiant presence who soothes sorrow, shields the vulnerable, and guides the wounded toward hope. She walks the threads of destiny with gentle hands, offering grace where others might bring judgment.
- Her symbols reflect her nurturing spirit: a heart surrounded by radiant light, a chalice overflowing with healing waters, and a pair of soft wings ready to shield or uplift.
- The sacred colours of her worship are soft pink, gold, and pure white- pink for tenderness, gold for divine protection, and white for purity and renewal.
- Creatures sacred to Seraphina include her Compassionate Angels- harpy-like beings reborn in mercy- along with white doves that embody peace, and butterflies whose delicate transformation mirrors the journey from pain to healing.

### Mythos & Legends
Seraphina, goddess of Compassion, Healing, Protection, and Fate, is the gentle hand that cradles the mortal world. Among the divine, she stands apart-not as a distant force, but as a guardian who truly cherishes mortal life. She sees beauty in fragility and hope in suffering, offering her grace not in abundance, but in moments that truly matter. When she intervenes, it is with purpose-and her presence changes the course of destiny.

One such moment is enshrined in the tale of a dying queen, her people on the brink of collapse. Seraphina, moved by the queen's unwavering devotion to peace, descended in silence and healed her. The queen lived, and her reign ushered in an age of harmony that echoed  across generations. Such is Seraphina's way-quiet, rare, and utterly transformative.

She is also known as The Mother of Duality, for from  her were born two of the most powerful gods: [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], the Bringer of Light, and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], the Harbinger of Chaos. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] she adores and often visits in the radiant Golden Plane, where mother and daughter share wisdom beyond time. But [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is her sorrow-a child born of grief, who twisted the flow of time into disorder. Yet even in her heartbreak, Seraphina's love endures. She does not shun him, but watches with aching hope that he may one day return to her light.

Her will is most often made manifest through her heralds, the Compassionate Angels-divine beings in the form of harpies, reborn as radiant messengers of healing and mercy. Where they pass, the air grows warm, the scent of blossoms fills the breeze, and
suffering yields to serenity. One tale tells of a village stricken by plague, its people near death, when an Angel descended in light and cured them all with a single breath. Since then, the villagers have tended a shrine of lilies in her honour, never letting it wilt.

Seraphina does not demand worship. She answers only when it matters most- and when she does, her touch lingers not as thunder, but as a balm. In every act of kindness, in every moment where hope defies despair,  her spirit endures- a quiet force of compassion shaping
the world, one soul at a time. 

### Worship & Rituals 
#### The Day Of Compassion
An annual festival held in her honour, the Day of Compassion is marked by acts of charity and healing. Devotees distribute food and clothing to the needy, and temples offer free medical care. Worshipers light candles in her name, praying for her continued guidance and blessings. 

#### The Chalice OF Healing
A sacred ritual performed by her priests involves consecrating water in a chalice adorned with her symbols. This water is said to carry Seraphina's blessing, providing miraculous healing to those who drink it or are anointed with it.

#### The Angel's Prayer
A nightly ritual observed by her faithful involves reciting the Angel's Prayer, a plea for protection and healing for loved ones. Many claim to have witnessed faint glimmers of light or the sound of soft wingbeats during the prayer, believed to be her Compassionate Angels at work.


### Artifacts & Relics
#### The Radiant Chalice
A golden goblet that never runs dry, capable of producing an endless flow of healing water when wielded by a true servant of Seraphina.

#### The Heart Of Mercy
A glowing crystal said to amplify the healing powers of
its bearer. It is kept within her grand temple and used in
times of dire need.

#### The Compassionate Viel
A shimmering cloth imbued with her essence, capable of instantly mending even mortal wounds. It is often carried by her highest priestesses.

Went to investigate and along a trail he came across a group of Harpies standing over the mangled corpse of another [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Divine Harpies\|Harpy]], something he knew would have been incredibly difficult to do, knowing their status as heralds of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]. he tentatively approached the situation before one called out to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | The room was quiet for a moment before korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had met any [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]'s, to which the headmaster said he had met the [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]]s but none of the others. When asked, the headmaster also explained that he and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] managed to stay alive for as long as they did because of forbidden magics, but would elaborate any further as they were forbidden after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]]          | The temple is huge and made of white marble with magical crystals and bubbles floating around the large building. There is a small town located around the temple. Inside there are people in similar white robes likes in [[Other Information/The Towers\|the towers]]. Before going in, Chenris pulls Mordecai aside and tells him not to mention their involvement with the gods this time, since he would like to look around. Mordecai sheepishly agrees to stay quiet. Chenris talks to the receptionist and pretends not to know who the all-father is. The receptionist is very accommodating and would love to answer questions about the gods. In this temple, they worship all of the Gods, especially [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Curious, Korrigan asks about their opinions on the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s. They say they like the heralds of gods who are seen as peace-loving and kind like [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] however, the heralds associated with gods like [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] often come to death's destruction so they would be hesitant to invite this in.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]]          | Chenris enquires about his opinions on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. The priest explains he was not a fan of the huge lose of life that the event caused. The priest elaborates, saying every God has their fanatics and extremists. Even the worshipers of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] have been known to use her name in vain and commit atrocities. Fortunately. There are moderates for every faith, including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. For example, the extremists believe that [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to come take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction. The moderates of the faction believe [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. The priest gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the humans, the Dwarves were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The humans, led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the OFC, there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the OFC is a pillar of freedom and equality. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | Mordecai laughs before saying that she needs to make sure that he does nothing stupid while they're gone, and she agrees. He finishes his spell and awkwardly leaves the room as he doesn't quite know how to end the conversation. Outside, Chenris and Korrigan are waiting, Chenris is rereading some of his research notes with a glum expression. Korrigan is looking in a nearby mirror, furiously trying to wipe away his "Duel Breaker" mark, but is unable to have any effect. They try examining the mark and have no idea how to get rid of it. Mordecai suggests finding a temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to see if she can remove it, as it might be a curse. In the meantime, Chenris suggest that Korrigan gets into wearing hats as Mordecai gets out his colour pallet and foundation colours and suggests they use makeup to cover it up for now. Korrigan says this ok as long as "You don't make me do red-face". Mordecai does their best, and most of the writing is mostly covered but is still slightly visible. Mordecai [Messages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/message) Chenris, saying that he is not to tell Korrigan how bad it looks. Chenris agrees.                                   |

[[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days.

Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active.

Having received his healing he felt more powerful than ever and felt that if he raised his hands at that very moment, then something big would happen. As he did so the world around him slowed to a halt, as a cruel God's laughter could be heard echoing in his head. No matter what he tried, time was stuck in this state of sinful silence. With little else to do, he began to wonder. The once familiar and vibrant world around him was now a shadow of itself, cold and unmoving. Eventually, he found his way to the wear the party had left the horse and carriage and moved them to a safe place in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] then wondered to what he hoped was [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]]. When all was said and done, Aidan had spent nearly a week wondering this wasteland alone desperate to hear anything that wasn't the laughter of his cruel patron. Eventually, he found the fort where he discovered Korrigan stuck motionless on the path.

Chenris investigates and learns that Lesser restoration is not enough to cure this curse, and suggests taking him to [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] but isn't sure if she will be willing to heal him due to his appeared alliance with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Before going in, Chenris pulls Mordecai aside and tells him not to mention their involvement with the gods this time, since he would like to look around. Mordecai sheepishly agrees to stay quiet. Chenris talks to the receptionist and pretends not to know who the all-father is. The receptionist is very accommodating and would love to answer questions about the gods. In this temple, they worship all of the Gods, especially [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Curious, Korrigan asks about their opinions on the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s. They say they like the heralds of gods who are seen as peace-loving and kind like [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] however, the heralds associated with gods like [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] often come to death's destruction so they would be hesitant to invite this in.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Chenris enquires about his opinions on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. The priest explains he was not a fan of the huge lose of life that the event caused. The priest elaborates, saying every God has their fanatics and extremists. Even the worshipers of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] have been known to use her name in vain and commit atrocities. Fortunately. There are moderates for every faith, including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. For example, the extremists believe that [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to come take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction. The moderates of the faction believe [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. The priest gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the humans, the Dwarves were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The humans, led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the OFC, there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the OFC is a pillar of freedom and equality. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | The two big Rizzmeisters (Korrigan and Mordecai) drag Drache to the temple to ask for her help in fixing him. Seraphina says that it interferes too much for her to do so but fixes Mordecais killer hangover. Korrigan then remembers the celestial phrase that Terrance Witherfeather used when he freed Korrigan from the ivory Crest years ago and found that it kinda put Drache into stasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
