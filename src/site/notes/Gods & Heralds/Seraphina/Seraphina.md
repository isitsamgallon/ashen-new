> "AND SERAPHINA MOVED AS LIGHT THROUGH broken glass, the Healer of Wounds and Restorer of the Forsaken. Her hands, anointed with celestial fire, knit together flesh and spirit; her song brought balm to the weary and peace to the tormented. Clad in the dawn 's embrace, she walks where sorrow dwells, and by her touch, the sick rise, the shattered are made whole, and the forgotten remember Jove."<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Seraphina is a calm and radiant presence whose touch restores what was broken, not with spectacle, but with quiet devotion. Clad in soft light and the scent of clean air after rain, she moves among the wounded and forgotten, healing not just bodies, but the burdens they
carry. She does not promise to fix all things - only that none will be left to suffer alone. In her presence, silence becomes sanctuary.

### General Information
Although there is no distinction between the moral standing of the deities, she often considered the closet to being a 'moral good' God. It seems she has temples in most major cities that can be used to access healing. 

Each of her temples has a [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]], which also acts as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], that provides all the healing for the people in place of Seraphina since she is unable to enter [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was revealed early on that Seraphina hates [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]].

### Divine Attributes
- Seraphina is the goddess of Compassion, Healing, Protection, Mercy, and Fate- a radiant presence who soothes sorrow, shields the vulnerable, and guides the wounded toward hope. She walks the threads of destiny with gentle hands, offering grace where others might bring judgment.
- Her symbols reflect her nurturing spirit: a heart surrounded by radiant light, a chalice overflowing with healing waters, and a pair of soft wings ready to shield or uplift.
- The sacred colours of her worship are soft pink, gold, and pure white- pink for tenderness, gold for divine protection, and white for purity and renewal.
- Creatures sacred to Seraphina include her Compassionate Angels- harpy-like beings reborn in mercy- along with white doves that embody peace, and butterflies whose delicate transformation mirrors the journey from pain to healing.

### Mythos & Legends
Seraphina, goddess of Compassion, Healing, Protection, and Fate, is the gentle hand that cradles the mortal world. Among the divine, she stands apart-not as a distant force, but as a guardian who truly cherishes mortal life. She sees beauty in fragility and hope in suffering, offering her grace not in abundance, but in moments that truly matter. When she intervenes, it is with purpose-and her presence changes the course of destiny.

One such moment is enshrined in the tale of a dying queen, her people on the brink of collapse. Seraphina, moved by the queen's unwavering devotion to peace, descended in silence and healed her. The queen lived, and her reign ushered in an age of harmony that echoed  across generations. Such is Seraphina's way-quiet, rare, and utterly transformative.

She is also known as The Mother of Duality, for from  her were born two of the most powerful gods: [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], the Bringer of Light, and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], the Harbinger of Chaos. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] she adores and often visits in the radiant Golden Plane, where mother and daughter share wisdom beyond time. But [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is her sorrow-a child born of grief, who twisted the flow of time into disorder. Yet even in her heartbreak, Seraphina's love endures. She does not shun him, but watches with aching hope that he may one day return to her light.

Her will is most often made manifest through her heralds, the Compassionate Angels-divine beings in the form of harpies, reborn as radiant messengers of healing and mercy. Where they pass, the air grows warm, the scent of blossoms fills the breeze, and
suffering yields to serenity. One tale tells of a village stricken by plague, its people near death, when an Angel descended in light and cured them all with a single breath. Since then, the villagers have tended a shrine of lilies in her honour, never letting it wilt.

Seraphina does not demand worship. She answers only when it matters most- and when she does, her touch lingers not as thunder, but as a balm. In every act of kindness, in every moment where hope defies despair,  her spirit endures- a quiet force of compassion shaping
the world, one soul at a time. 

### Worship & Rituals 
#### The Day Of Compassion
An annual festival held in her honour, the Day of Compassion is marked by acts of charity and healing. Devotees distribute food and clothing to the needy, and temples offer free medical care. Worshipers light candles in her name, praying for her continued guidance and blessings. 

#### The Chalice OF Healing
A sacred ritual performed by her priests involves consecrating water in a chalice adorned with her symbols. This water is said to carry Seraphina's blessing, providing miraculous healing to those who drink it or are anointed with it.

#### The Angel's Prayer
A nightly ritual observed by her faithful involves reciting the Angel's Prayer, a plea for protection and healing for loved ones. Many claim to have witnessed faint glimmers of light or the sound of soft wingbeats during the prayer, believed to be her Compassionate Angels at work.


### Artifacts & Relics

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | The two big Rizzmeisters (Korrigan and Mordecai) drag Drache to the temple to ask for her help in fixing him. Seraphina says that it interferes too much for her to do so but fixes Mordecais killer hangover. Korrigan then remembers the celestial phrase that Terrance Witherfeather used when he freed Korrigan from the ivory Crest years ago and found that it kinda put Drache into stasis. |
