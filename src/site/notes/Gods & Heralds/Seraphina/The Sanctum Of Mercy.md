> "AND IN THE HOUR OF BREAKING, THE WEARY shall be lifted, cradled in wings of still light. Their pain shall be remembered, not to wound, but to heal-and in the Sanctum, sorrow shall sleep beside hope, and be made whole."<cite>Scripture of the Gentle Dawn, Passage 5:12 </cite>

### Overview
The divine realm of Seraphina, goddess of Compassion, Healing, Protection, and Fate, is known as the Sanctum of Mercy-a place of gentle light, endless skies, and soft silence. Floating among clouds of gold and pale rose, the realm takes the form of a vast, radiant sanctuary suspended above an endless sea of light. It is a place of rest, recovery, and quiet strength, where even the deepest wounds of the soul begin to mend.

The Sanctum is built upon sky-islands wreathed in flowering meadows and silver streams, where the wind sings in tones too soft to be remembered, yet never forgotten. At its heart stands the Hall of Still Waters, a luminous cathedral of marble and glass, open to the sky
and surrounded by gardens of lilies, doves, and glowing moths. Within it, Seraphina herself tends the Font of Renewal- a pool said to hold the distilled essence of healing, drawn from the hopes and prayers of mortals.

Souls that enter this realm arrive in their moment of greatest need-not necessarily in death, but sometimes through divine dream or calling. Here, they are tended by Compassionate Angels, divine harpies whose presence brings comfort instead of fear, their wings glowing with golden light and their voices like distant lullabies. The angels guide the weary to rest, the wounded to healing, and the broken to wholeness though not always in the way they expect.

The realm is divided not by land, but by purpose. Some sky-islands are places of refuge, where the grieving and weary dwell in peace. Others are places of reflection, where souls relive moments of regret, not to be punished, but to find closure. Still others are places of
joy- where laughter and reunion bloom among flowers that never fade. Each soul is given what they need, whether they know it or not.

And always, above it all, the Threads of Fate glimmer in the sky- golden strands of light that twist and weave endlessly across the firmament. Seraphina watches them with gentle eyes, adjusting only when absolutely necessary, her hand guided not by power, but by compassion.

The Sanctum of Mercy is not a paradise free of sorrow but a realm that accepts it, holds it, and helps it heal. Here, rest is sacred, tears are never wasted, and even the most shattered soul may find peace in time.
