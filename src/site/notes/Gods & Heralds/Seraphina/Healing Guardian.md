| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] | The room was quiet for a moment before korrigan asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had met any [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]'s, to which the headmaster said he had met the [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]]s but none of the others. When asked, the headmaster also explained that he and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] managed to stay alive for as long as they did because of forbidden magics, but would elaborate any further as they were forbidden after all. |
