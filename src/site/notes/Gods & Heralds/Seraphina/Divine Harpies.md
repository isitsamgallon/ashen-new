#INFORMATION_MISSING_OR_OUT-OF-DATE 
### Overview
Harpys are [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]].

### History
Long ago, the Harpies were not aligned with any god and were generally considered a weak race. Eventually, they began to be hunted to the brink of extinction. For some unknown reason, [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] decided to intervene and made the entire race her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s. Due to their new status as [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s, they are now unable to procreate, which means their population cannot increase. However, they also cannot die of old age. As a result, in the rare event that a Harpy is killed, they are lost forever.
