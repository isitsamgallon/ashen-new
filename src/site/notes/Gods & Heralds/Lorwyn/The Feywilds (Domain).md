> "THE MUSHROOMS SANG ME SECRETS IN THE shape of my grandmother's elbows, and the sky blinked twice, so I married the moon and divorced a teacup. Don't trust the ducks-they know the riddles and they owe the frogs nothing." <cite> Crazy Larry</cite>

### Overview
The [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] are a realm of chaos wrapped in beauty, ruled by whimsy, illusion, and emotion. A twisted mirror of the mortal world, the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] pulse with colour too vivid, sounds too sharp, and magic too alive to be contained by logic or time. It is a place where dreams take root and bloom into realities, where every step could take you to wonder-or madness.

At the heart of the realm stands the Temple of Bloom, the seat of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] and the radiant Summer Court. This grand structure, woven from flowering trees, glowing vines, and ever-shifting crystal, is both palace and garden, alive with eternal revelry and dangerous charm.
Here, laughter is currency, riddles are law, and joy often conceals a knife.

Hidden deep within the tangled layers of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] lies the Winter Temple- a cold and silent place that few ever find unless the Winter Court wills it. Cloaked in mist and woven illusions, it hums with s low, ancient magic and the sound of distant bells. While the Summer Court plays, the Winter Court plots, watching the chaos unfold from behind frost-glass mirrors.

The Changing Plains stretch like a painter's palette spilled across reality. Hills become lakes, trees become towers, and the horizon shifts with every blink. Time flows unpredictably here; a mortal lost in the plains may wander for what feels like a lifetime, only to stumble
back into the material world minutes later- or never return at all.

To the south lies the Mycelial Swamp, a dense forest of mushroom caps the size of houses and gnarled oak trees with bark like stone. The air is thick with spores and illusions, and the ground beneath the surface churns with sinking mud so deep it could drown giants. The swamp is a graveyard of lost explorers and a sanctuary for ancient fey who prefer their secrets buried in muck and memory.

But the strangest and most dangerous places in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] are the sovereign domains-pockets of reality wholly owned and shaped by powerful fey lords or ladies. In these zones, the world bends entirely to their will. A door might open into your childhood home, a battlefield, or a starlit void. These domains are used to seduce, trick, test, or torment mortals, shifting shape with a thought and hiding malicious intent beneath familiar smiles.

No map of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] stays true for long. Paths vanish, mountains move, and emotions twist the land itself. To enter is to surrender certainty. To leave is a gift not often given.

The Everfair Market is a roving, interdimensional bazaar that appears only when it wishes- often at twilight or during times of emotional upheaval. Here, both mortals and fey barter in strange currencies: memories, dreams, names, laughter, or years of life. Stalls shimmer into existence between towering mushrooms or in the ruins of forgotten halls, vanishing
again when the last deal is struck. Nothing in the Everfair is truly safe, but for those who understand the rules- or are bold enough to ignore them- it offers wares found nowhere else in the realms.

It is often said that even the gods do not fully understand the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. To catalogue its many groves, courts, domains, and unspoken laws would take lifetimes- and still only scratch the surface. The [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]] are not meant to be known, only experienced... and those who do seldom return unchanged.
