> "AND LORWYN DANCED UPON THE WIND, VEILED IN Purple and crowned with madness, the jester-Queen of Shadows. Her laughter confounded kings and prophets Alike, for she spoke in riddles and cloaked the truth in Illusion, that the wise might stumble and the fool see Clearly.""<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Lorwyn is a trickster cloaked in illusion and crowned in Laughter, dancing on the edge of dreams and madness. She wears royalty like a costume and truth like a riddle, Reshaping reality with a flick of her fingers. To know her Is to question what is real - not because she lies, but Because she shows how fragile certainty can be. She is Chaos wrapped in beauty, and beauty wrapped in a joke No one fully understands.

### General Information
She rules over the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] s and the Fey creatures that inhabit that realm. For the longest time, she had no known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], until it was revealed that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] had become one. When [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] died in [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] he made a deal with her. 

In exchange for a return to life infused with fey magic, Kal's memories would be wiped clean upon re-entering the material plane, and he would emerge as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] of Lorwyn, However, there was a condition: after Kal had finished his unfinished business, he would then have to destroy the Divine Pillar in [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|lost haven]].

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] seems to be aware of Lorwyn's intentions.


### Divine Attributes
- Lorwyn is the wild heart of Nature touched by Deception, Chaos, Trickery, and Change. Ever shifting and untamed, they delight in misdirection and transformation, blurring the line between what is real and what is imagined, all in playful service to deeper, hidden truths. 
- Their symbols are as elusive as their nature: a crescent moon surrounded by flickering fireflies, a fox mask concealing laughter and cunning, and an oak leaf caught in a swirl of wind- each a reflection of whimsy and unpredictability.
- The sacred colors of their worship are green, gold, and twilight purple- green for nature's ever-turning cycle, gold for cleverness and allure, and purple for the mystery that hides between dusk and dream. 
- Fey creatures are most sacred to Lorwyn: mischievous sprites that stir up harmless chaos, sly fox-spirits who dance at the edge of illusion, and serene, deer-like fey whose quiet presence masks ancient and subtle magic.

### Mythos & Legends
Lorwyn, goddess of Trickery, Change, and the Fey, is a being of whimsy and contradiction-both revered and feared as the ever-shifting spirit of mischief. Born of wild places and half-spoken dreams, she dances at the edges of order, reshaping the world not through force,
but through cleverness, illusion, and a well-timed laugh. To worship Lorwyn is to embrace the unexpected, to find meaning in chaos, and to trust that even the crooked path may lead to beauty.

The Trickster's Dance is one of the oldest and most beloved tales told in her name. In it, Lorwyn lures gods and mortals alike into a game of riddles played over a blighted land. Through deceit, laughter, and misdirection, she transforms a cursed and barren region into a thriving forest-proving that her chaos is not destruction, but wild, creative rebirth. She is a disruptor, yes, but also a healer in disguise.

Mortals who encounter her often find themselves entangled in strange and binding pacts, receiving gifts of power, transformation, or fate itself-always given with terms that reveal their full meaning only when it's too late to turn back. One enduring legend tells of a queen
who asked for eternal prosperity for her people. Lorwyn granted it-but in doing so, reshaped the land so wildly that the people no longer recognized their home, nor the
ruler who made the deal. Such stories reveal her gifts as double-edged: generous, but never without price.

Lorwyn is also the undisputed guardian of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], a realm as fluid and unpredictable as she is. During the cataclysmic Sundering, when the boundaries of the planes threatened to shatter, it was her illusions, tricks, and shifting terrain that shielded countless fey from
annihilation. Her laughter became their shield, her riddles their s alvation.

To serve Lorwyn is to let go of certainty and embrace the dance of change. She is the rustle in the leaves, the sudden shift in wind, the smile you didn't expect. In her realm, truth wears a mask- and sometimes, the mask tells more than the face beneath.

### Worship & Rituals 
#### The Festival of Twilight 
Worshipers of Lorwyn celebrate her influence through the Festival of Twilight, a night of masks, riddles, and dancing under the moon. Participants exchange cryptic stories, believing that she grants blessings to those who can deceive or amuse her through their tales.

#### The Riddle's Oath 
To gain Lorwyn's favour, devotees partake in a sacred ritual called the Riddle's Oath, where they present her a riddle or mystery. It is said that Lorwyn answers only the most cunning of riddles, rewarding the asker with a boon.

#### The Grove's whisper
In sacred groves dedicated to Lorwyn, her followers meditate to seek guidance. These sessions often involve listening to the rustle of leaves or the calls of animals, which are interpreted as her subtle communication.

### Artifacts & Relics
#### The Mask Of Infinite Faces 
A magical mask that shifts appearances to reflect the wearer's intentions, aiding in deception and trickery.

#### The Feyflame Lantern
A lantern that never dims, illuminating paths through the[[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\| Feywil]]d but sometimes leading wanderers astray if their hearts are untrue.

#### The Oaken Staff
A relic that grants dominion over fey creatures and the ability to summon temporary glades for protection or rest.

AND LOOK, NOW I HAVE HORNS."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Before the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] could firmly reject the idea based on past experiences, Sylvia agreed with a smirk, and they both disappeared. When Sylvia opened her eyes, she found herself in a quiet part of a meadow where he once made his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He invited her to sit down and admire the view of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. She sat down, amazed by its untamed beauty. After a few moments, she turned to him, and with a coy smile, she asked, "We're you really that desperate to get some alone time with me?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | "Yeah, I appeared here, and [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] came up to me, and we made a deal", Kerrigan explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned. |

They turn to face the character and the person looks and sounds exactly like Kal but this person has antlers. He calls himself Korrigan and has amnesia. The group takes him in more out of curiosity (Chenris keep trying to securely study him).  Mordecai then scare Korrigans  into using his abilities to learn more about him and his abilities. [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] 's name comes up a lot when talking about his powers, he even has Kal's Bow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
