> "AND LORWYN DANCED UPON THE WIND, VEILED IN Purple and crowned with madness, the jester-Queen of Shadows. Her laughter confounded kings and prophets Alike, for she spoke in riddles and cloaked the truth in Illusion, that the wise might stumble and the fool see Clearly.""<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Lorwyn is a trickster cloaked in illusion and crowned in Laughter, dancing on the edge of dreams and madness. She wears royalty like a costume and truth like a riddle, Reshaping reality with a flick of her fingers. To know her Is to question what is real - not because she lies, but Because she shows how fragile certainty can be. She is Chaos wrapped in beauty, and beauty wrapped in a joke No one fully understands.

### General Information
She rules over the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] s and the Fey creatures that inhabit that realm. For the longest time, she had no known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], until it was revealed that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] had become one. When [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] died in [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] he made a deal with her. 

In exchange for a return to life infused with fey magic, Kal's memories would be wiped clean upon re-entering the material plane, and he would emerge as [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] of Lorwyn, However, there was a condition: after Kal had finished his unfinished business, he would then have to destroy the Divine Pillar in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]].

[[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] seems to be aware of Lorwyn's intentions.


### Divine Attributes
- Lorwyn is the wild heart of Nature touched by Deception, Chaos, Trickery, and Change. Ever shifting and untamed, they delight in misdirection and transformation, blurring the line between what is real and what is imagined, all in playful service to deeper, hidden truths. 
- Their symbols are as elusive as their nature: a crescent moon surrounded by flickering fireflies, a fox mask concealing laughter and cunning, and an oak leaf caught in a swirl of wind- each a reflection of whimsy and unpredictability.
- The sacred colors of their worship are green, gold, and twilight purple- green for nature's ever-turning cycle, gold for cleverness and allure, and purple for the mystery that hides between dusk and dream. 
- Fey creatures are most sacred to Lorwyn: mischievous sprites that stir up harmless chaos, sly fox-spirits who dance at the edge of illusion, and serene, deer-like fey whose quiet presence masks ancient and subtle magic.

### Mythos & Legends
Lorwyn, goddess of Trickery, Change, and the Fey, is a being of whimsy and contradiction-both revered and feared as the ever-shifting spirit of mischief. Born of wild places and half-spoken dreams, she dances at the edges of order, reshaping the world not through force,
but through cleverness, illusion, and a well-timed laugh. To worship Lorwyn is to embrace the unexpected, to find meaning in chaos, and to trust that even the crooked path may lead to beauty.

The Trickster's Dance is one of the oldest and most beloved tales told in her name. In it, Lorwyn lures gods and mortals alike into a game of riddles played over a blighted land. Through deceit, laughter, and misdirection, she transforms a cursed and barren region into a thriving forest-proving that her chaos is not destruction, but wild, creative rebirth. She is a disruptor, yes, but also a healer in disguise.

Mortals who encounter her often find themselves entangled in strange and binding pacts, receiving gifts of power, transformation, or fate itself-always given with terms that reveal their full meaning only when it's too late to turn back. One enduring legend tells of a queen
who asked for eternal prosperity for her people. Lorwyn granted it-but in doing so, reshaped the land so wildly that the people no longer recognized their home, nor the
ruler who made the deal. Such stories reveal her gifts as double-edged: generous, but never without price.

Lorwyn is also the undisputed guardian of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], a realm as fluid and unpredictable as she is. During the cataclysmic Sundering, when the boundaries of the planes threatened to shatter, it was her illusions, tricks, and shifting terrain that shielded countless fey from
annihilation. Her laughter became their shield, her riddles their s alvation.

To serve Lorwyn is to let go of certainty and embrace the dance of change. She is the rustle in the leaves, the sudden shift in wind, the smile you didn't expect. In her realm, truth wears a mask- and sometimes, the mask tells more than the face beneath.

### Worship & Rituals 
#### The Festival of Twilight 
Worshipers of Lorwyn celebrate her influence through the Festival of Twilight, a night of masks, riddles, and dancing under the moon. Participants exchange cryptic stories, believing that she grants blessings to those who can deceive or amuse her through their tales.

#### The Riddle's Oath 
To gain Lorwyn's favour, devotees partake in a sacred ritual called the Riddle's Oath, where they present her a riddle or mystery. It is said that Lorwyn answers only the most cunning of riddles, rewarding the asker with a boon.

#### The Grove's whisper
In sacred groves dedicated to Lorwyn, her followers meditate to seek guidance. These sessions often involve listening to the rustle of leaves or the calls of animals, which are interpreted as her subtle communication.

### Artifacts & Relics
#### The Mask Of Infinite Faces 
A magical mask that shifts appearances to reflect the wearer's intentions, aiding in deception and trickery.

#### The Feyflame Lantern
A lantern that never dims, illuminating paths through the[[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\| Feywil]]d but sometimes leading wanderers astray if their hearts are untrue.

#### The Oaken Staff
A relic that grants dominion over fey creatures and the ability to summon temporary glades for protection or rest.

It does not matter how high he builds his towers or how thick his walls are. We will arise again, and we will kill him. Fear is a powerful motivator, which is why he keeps us here. I rose to the rebellion ten years ago. And he thought he killed me. Now I have returned."

[[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decided it would be best to find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Shoni Anofora\|Shoni Anofora]], rather than risk needing help from [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] again. He quickly discovered a tavern down the road where the bartender, a dwarf, was speaking simply while pouring drinks for various customers. When Aiden asked about Shoni, the bartender replied, “I’m no good at remembering. Do you have something to jog my memory?” Reluctantly, Aiden pushed a few extra coins across the counter, and the bartender began to speak more formally. He explained that he had heard of Shoni and that she was last known to be heading south. With another payment, he detailed that she was working in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the Desert]], beyond [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]]. Aiden thanked him for the information and returned to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], who refused to believe him, citing the bartender's poor command of Common.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, it was missing the cog, second and minute hands, and the pendulum.

Turning to [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], she lifted him by his throat before any of them could react and told him to keep his promise to become a better person. Scared out of his mind, he nodded frantically before she let him go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]], who was nearly in tears at this point, said that they could go to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] and open the shop there. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] insisted that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] didn't have Cancer, which only convinced them that they had "Death Disease". [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was about to say something else, but [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] stepped in, saying that he had a way to make [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] feel better. They said they would be more than happy to have a distraction, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] teleported both of them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] waited in the [[Locations/Feywild/Temple of Lorwyn\|Temple of Lorwyn]] while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] found themselves in front of the familiar wooden shake in [[Locations/Feywild/The Shifting Forest\|The Shifting Forest]]. They tentatively approached and knocked on the door, and the beautiful [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] they once knew was now very old, she instantly recognised them and invited them in. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that they said they would return before asking what their name was they now realise they never got it when they were last here. She laughed before introducing herself as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jessamine †\|Jessamine †]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]              | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], but before they could do anything, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] fell to the floor, shaking violently. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] lay in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]'s arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] replied with anger none of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 32\|Session 32]]              | Taken back, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained even if they had a sword, they wouldn't have given him one because of how strange they were acting, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] seconded this. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] realised this and backtracked a little, explaining he also needed to go there to destroy [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] for [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], but more importantly, Chenis was here, and he jumped up to say 'Hi' to his old friend, but [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]] didn't respond. With a warty glance at Chneris, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] rushed to the still-panicking [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and tried to help them calm down and introduce [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|chenris]]. Explaining that they well may already know of them, but this is their old friend who died recently, and as much as they hated to admit it, they all really missed him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a long look at [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]] before stating "Y- y-y- eah, why does it feel like i know him, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]? Why does he feel like a part of me, a part I cannot escape no matter where I run to?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] tried to calm him down and told him to start from the beginning and explain how their [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] works. After a few deep breaths, they explained that their version works slightly differently from the more common version. He functions by taking him through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s before appearing in the spot he wanted. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] paused for a moment before suggesting that maybe their ability malfunctioned and sent [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] but left them there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] filed with his bow for a moment before saying that could be the case as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no way out of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and so could be trapped. A moment passed for [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]'s eyes widened in panic as he screamed, "OH MY GOD, [[The Party/Halfbie\|HALFBIE]] IS IN THE [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|FEYWILD]]!" before teleporting there himself. He landed in his usual spot: outside a golden temple dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He threw out his magic, searching for this friend and breathed a sigh of relief, and he sensed them moving to them slowly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]], happy that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was safe, let out a heavy sigh and simply stated that it was good that the rift didn't do too much damage to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s. They updated [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] as they had legitimately forgotten what was happening in the human and that they needed to get out of there. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] figured that their best bet would be to just walk right out as the guards saw them walk in with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], so they probably wouldn't care if they walked out. they do just that, and the guards don't even bat an eye as they walk up the stairs and into the main library of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]].

Before entering, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] thought that to give [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] a proper introduction to the Fey, he had to play a prank on the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. He explained that a proper Fey greeting involved clapping three times, turning around, tapping their head, and saying "Oeurrr". [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] seemed sceptical at first, especially when he asked for confirmation; [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] then said the sequence in a different order.

Mordecai tries to explain how [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] isn't all good as they offer information, but it will often come at a cost.

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | While discussing Aidan's fear of the deity, Korrigan mentions Aidan's possession in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. Upon hearing this, the priest perks up and says he knowns all about that incident and therefore knows Aidan very well and applauds him for a job well done. Pissed off, Korrigan asks what he means by that. The priest elaborates and says that Aidan did what his god wanted him to do, which is something to congratulate him on. Korrigan turns on his heels and grabs Aidan to leave, as they are Aidan shouts "WHAT AM I?!". The priest isn't sure but if had to guess he would say "You're [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' - you belong to him". Aidan starts to cry at this revelation and the priest says "i'd be careful around [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]] if i were you". This stops Korrigan in his tracks and asks him what does he mean. The priest elaborates that "Well, you caused one tower to fall, i'm sure he would like to see another fall". korri exclaims "SO WOULD [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|LORWYN]]" and leaves just before the priest calls [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] a feckless bastard. Being dragged out, Aidan's last view of the priest is distorted and his face is replaced by a big black smile of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

He explains this is one of the main reasons he joined [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]]'s Druid circle, the circle of endless bloom, so he could become more than just a herald and apart of the fey court in his own right. The Priest advises to lean into the joke, life will become a lot easier that way. Korrigan mentions the man giggling outside and how he wanted to be apart of that joke. upon hearing this. the priest ushers him closer and whispers that that man was a bandit who had just murdered many people right before the party rocked up and they were lucky to get through so easily.  Korrigan recounts some of the harmless pranks he's pulled on people. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Tangy\|Tangy]] has fun ideas for the joke to play at the party and the priest just laughs and says to carry on with his path.

Korrigan instantly agrees before the other two can question what she means by this. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Queen Titania\|Queen Titania]] laughs as the deal has been made.

After so many revelations in such a short space of time time, the party travel the rest of the distance in silent contemplation as they try to figure out who the trait is within their ranks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

They turn to face the character and the person looks and sounds exactly like Kal but this person has antlers. He calls himself Korrigan and has amnesia. The group takes him in more out of curiosity (Chenris keep trying to securely study him).  Mordecai then scare Korrigans  into using his abilities to learn more about him and his abilities.
