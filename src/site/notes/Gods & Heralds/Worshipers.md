### Overview
Many of the mortals in the [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] worship one of the many deities, with each follower often mimicking the god they worship. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]
Her followers are seekers of truth-scholars, sages, and visionaries who devote their lives to the pursuit of knowledge. They believe that wisdom is the purest form of light, capable of dispelling even the deepest darkness.

### [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] 
Those who follow Chronovorus range from desperate time-beggars to chaos-driven zealots. They see the unravelling of order as liberation, and time's instability as divine. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] 
Eldros's faithful are quiet stewards of balance-druids, monks, and caretakers who intervene only when harmony is threatened. To them, every action must serve the whole, no matter the cost. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] 
His followers burn with purpose, seeing destruction as sacred and necessary. While many are fiery zealots who embrace the cleansing flame, others follow a more tempered path-believing in controlled renewal, forging strength through hardship rather than indiscriminate ruin. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Lyria/Lyria\|Lyria]] 
Lyria's devotees are poets, lovers, and hedonists who embrace the ecstasy and agony of desire. Many who live by passion-especially courtesans and prostitutes-pray to her for protection, charm, and love that lingers beyond the night. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] 
The Summer and Winter Courts are the most devoted followers of Lorwyn, bound to her by pact and purpose within the ever-shifting [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. As living extensions of the Trickster Goddess, they embody opposing facets of her chaos, charm, and unpredictable nature. 

#### The Summer Court
Vibrant, radiant, and capriciously kind, the Summer Court thrives on passion, joy, and beauty. Its members are artists, seducers, and revellers who wield mischief with a warm smile and a dagger behind the back. Their enchantments are dazzling, their chaos playful-until it turns. 

#### The Winter Court
Cold, clever, and cruelly elegant, the Winter Court embraces subtlety, illusion, and quiet menace. These fey deal in secrets, bargains, and half-truths, preferring slow unravelling to open jest. Their laughter is soft, but their games can ruin kings. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]  
Her followers are healers, caretakers, and guardians of the vulnerable. They act with compassion and purpose, offering hope in even the darkest of places. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] 
Dreamers, mystics, and oracles make up Somnora's faithful, walking the edge between sleep and wake. They seek hidden truths in dreams, trusting the goddess to guide through symbols and silence. 

### [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] 
His followers are quiet, reverent, and solemn morticians, archivists, and memory-keepers who honour the dignity of endings. Though few devote their lives to him, all eventually offer a prayer to Vaelrith when the final moment comes.
