> "AND LO, AELORIA CAME FORTH CLOAKED IN radiant light, the Keeper of Knowledge, whose eyes beheld the secrets of the firmament. Around her did the holy tomes revolve, and her voice was as a thousand whispers of truth, guiding the faithful and forbidding the unworthy. " <cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Aeloria is a radiant, near-divine being who embodies the pursuit of understanding and the quiet power of truth. She appears as a serene, luminous figure surrounded by drifting books and soft light, moving through the world not as a conqueror, but as a guide. She exists in the spaces between thought and revelation, drawn to those who seek meaning, and offering glimpses of clarity to those willing to listen. 

### General Information
Living in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/The Golden Plane\|her grand library]]. She dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. She has no physical form in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], however, she often pulls people up to The Golden Plain to communicate with her directly, where she chooses to take the form of an elven woman wearing all white. 

She has a group of followers known as [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] who sign a pact with her on initiation, meaning that she gets their eternal soul to act as a researcher while they get whatever knowledge they may require.

Aeloria is seen as generally a good god who dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. However, she can also be quite cruel in what she asks for in return for knowledge, like when [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] visit her room in the [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|All-Father Temple]].

### Divine Attributes
 - Aeloria reigns over the divine domains of Light, Knowledge, Hope, and Enlightenment, each facet reflecting her eternal role as the guide of minds and the bearer of sacred truth. Her presence inspires clarity where there was once confusion, and warmth where there was despair.
 - Her symbol is a radiant sunburst cradling an open book at its heart, often accompanied by a golden quill encircled by a halo of light - emblems of revelation, learning, and divine inspiration made manifest.
 - The sacred colors of her worship are gold, white, and soft azure: gold for divine wisdom, white for purity of purpose, and azure for the serene depths of understanding.
 - Creatures held dear to her are the golden dove, a messenger of hope; the white stag, a silent guardian and beacon of guidance; and the luminous moth, ever-drawn to the light of hidden truths, fluttering at the threshold between ignorance and knowing.

### Mythos & legend
Aeloria is revered as the divine spark that illuminates shadowed minds and lost paths. She was born from [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] during an age when mortals cried out not only for healing, but for understanding. In answer to their pleas, [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] wept tears of starlight-tears that became Aeloria, a being of radiant insight. Where her brother [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would later embody the chaos of time, Aeloria arose as its guide, bringing order to its flow and meaning to its moments. 

She is the eternal teacher, the bearer of sacred truth, and the light at the edge of the unknown. Among her most beloved myths is the tale of an exiled tribe lost in a barren land. With no map but the stars above, it was Aeloria who came to them in silence, teaching them to read the night sky. Through her wisdom, they transformed desolation into abundance, and despair into purpose-a testament to her gift of knowledge as salvation. 

But Aeloria's light does not go unchallenged. Her twin in divine opposition is [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], her brother and rival, whose birth mirrored hers in timing but not in spirit. While she preserves, he unravels; while she brings clarity, he sows uncertainty. Their struggle echoes across [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|the Amber Realms]], influencing the fate of empires and the choices of mortals. It is said that whenever a great discovery is made, or a great lie exposed, their silent battle flares anew. 

Her most devoted followers, [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]], enter into a sacred pact-granted boundless knowledge in life, they pledge their eternal souls to her after death. In the radiant halls of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/The Golden Plane\|The Golden Plane]], they become eternal scholars, uncovering the truths of the cosmos within her celestial library. Yet even here, caution is whispered: one tale tells of a scholar who reached too far, unearthing forbidden knowledge and becoming lost in endless research, burdened by truths never meant for mortal minds. 

Aeloria is not merely a goddess of learning-she is its light. She does not demand worship, but invites seekers. In her presence, confusion gives way to clarity, and ignorance to revelation. And through her, the eternal question becomes a path, lit gently by stars. 

### Worship & Rituals
#### The illumination Festival 
This grand event takes place during the longest day of the year. Worshippers light countless lanterns and share tales of inspiration and triumph, symbolizing the spreading of knowledge and hope. The festival concludes with a communal vow to pursue truth in all endeavors. 

#### The Ascension of The Mind 
A meditative ritual involving starlight reflection in holy pools, symbolizing enlightenment. Devotees focus their minds on questions plaguing them, often emerging with newfound clarity attributed to Aeloria's blessings. 

#### The Oath of Light
Devotees take this sacred oath when joining her clergy or becoming Golden Ones. The initiation involves writing one's life goal on a golden parchment and burning it in her light, signifying surrender to her divine wisdom. 

### Artifacts & Relics
#### Tome of Radiance
A mystical book containing infinite pages, capable of revealing knowledge from any realm. Its inscriptions are written in shifting celestial languages. 

#### The Lantern of Eternal Guidence
A lantern that never extinguishes, offering light in the darkest places. It also reveals hidden truths. 

#### The Quill of illumination
A golden quill that writes truths yet untold, used by her highest priests to record prophecies and divine insights.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]]              | With that out of the way, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] continued on and found a multifaith church. The building was old and rotting, and the inside wasn't much better, as it was completely empty and dilapidated. On the far end were 4 altars. One was dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and the last to [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]. They approached the altar and laid the lavender on it. They all turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked him to pray. After doing so, the lavender vanished, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] felt a rush of strange energy wash over them. As [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the one to pray, he immediately knew that this was a boon from [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and would allow them to sleep anywhere and not fear the consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]]              | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] quickly got up and began to leave. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stopped and said they had an idea. They began to write down the events of what they saw in [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]]'s celestial plane. They then put that on [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s altar and prayed. This led to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] receiving a new boon that told them about all the interesting things in the area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly rushed to the door as they arrived and politely knocked before entering. Tourists paused to look at him quizzically before resuming their way through the open double doors of the temple. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked confused in return, as all they knew was that it was polite to knock before entering somewhere, especially somewhere important. Irritated by [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s naïvety, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] pushed past him - announcing to the group that he wanted to take [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to see [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] with a glint of contempt in their eye. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was growing desperate for answers, not just about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], but also [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. They were confident that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|she]] was responsible for all this, but why? Why would she go to these lengths? Why was he the only one freaking out?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | Anxious for answers, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] stormed into [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]’s worship room, practically pulling [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] by the scruff of their neck. Seeing the same orb as before, their voice came out more like a demand than the question they had intended. They requested to know more about what was happening with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and whether it was possible to dispose of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]]. The orb considered for a moment before revealing that they were more than happy to share this information, but it would come at a cost. The orb was willing to trade the information [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sought in exchange for their knowledge that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] was the Empress of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. The orb clarified that this would affect the entire party. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] was uncertain if this was a deal they could make on behalf of the whole group and asked if they could wait for the others to return and consult them for their opinions.

The orb broke the silence by saying they were happy to wait; in fact, they could teleport [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] into the room as soon as they were available. The orb then appeared very confused, looking flustered for the first time as it revealed that it was unsure of where the two were. The orb explained that it had knowledge of all the things that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] knew, yet had no idea where they were, which would have been impossible unless they were in a place beyond [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s control. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they go to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]’s room, but the orb revealed that this was still a location it could see. It might make sense if the two were taken to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]].

He takes the time to ask them if they worship a god like he worships [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly explains that they worship [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], which shocks Korrigan and Mordecai. They explain that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] is the one who has helped them out the most that they can remember, so it only seemed right that they worship them. The two ask for some examples, to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explains that [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] helped them learn new spells and help them find a [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|friend]]. However, when Mordecai asks who their friend is, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cannot remember, blinking blankly as they become confused. Mordecai tries to explain how [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] isn't all good as they offer information, but it will often come at a cost. They tell how Chenris was tricked into exchanging their soul for information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Korrigan began to agree with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], saying that people are usually made well aware of the consequences of each deal before making them. Before finishing their sentence, they paused and asked how [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] could know something like that. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], for their part, blinked blankly again before admitting they had no idea. The two studied the Eldarin for a moment before continuing their conversation. As the conversation ends, korrigan takes the time to thank [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] for being so helpful with the forcefield and in fights. Mordecai blows on both of them, saying, "Yeah, I know they're useful; they can do everything I can do but better!!" before storming off.

To his surprise, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had no idea what [[The Party/The Korrigan\|korrigan]] was saying, asking them to speak in common. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was bewildered, screaming, "HOW DOES A FEY NOT SPEAK SYLVAN?!?". He was so shocked he had to inspect [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] further to confirm their fey status and confirmed that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was, in fact, Eldarin - definitely a fey specifies. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] starts to cycle through all of his known languages to see what [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would respond to. He first tried Primordial to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responded confused, asking why they were now speaking Primordial, noting it felt like they were excluding the rest of the group. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ignored him and carried on his test and learnt that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] knew all the same languages as Chenris. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] surmised that the big tell would be to get them to respond to Ancient Dwarven so they asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] for something and she flatly said "something" in Ancient Dwarven. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] responds in kind, still very confused but putting further credence to their theory that [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]] and chenris' memories must have merged. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] sighs deeply and absent-mindedly questions "Why would [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|she]] do this??"                                                                                                                                         |

They walk through the portal and encounter a room filled with clocks, all progressing at different speeds. At the back of the room, near the alter is a large time disturbance with a few crystals floating around it. Korrigan immediately recognises these as the very same ones that are found at the top of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Aidan is too afraid to say anything so Korrigan says hi to the priest - and old, dishevelled man. He greets them and asks if there is anything they would like to talk about. They say they have a few questions about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. They say that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is a bad God and they want to know why he does what he does. The priest laments as he does not have the authority to answer that question. He does say that all of the Gods act on their own interests and what is best for them and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is the same. They ask who's authority he speaks of and just says that he is just a priest and wouldn't dare speak for the deity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | They return to the main library area where Korrigan says that Aidan needs to learn how to use his magic. He explains that it often activates when you really need to use the magic and while the magic does come from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], it is Aidan's will to do what he wants with the energy. This helps him calm down until he hears in his ear "or my will" from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Some time later, Chenris and Mordecai return from [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|Aeloria's room]] looking incredibly troubled, especially Mordecai. Chenris still looks incredibly angry, still in his summer form. Korrigan tries to ask what happened and all Mordecai can muster is a meek sorry. He goes on to explain that he was offered a deal and now looking back he really regrets not taking it. If he had, then everyone would know all about [[Uti †\|Uti †]] and so much more but it came a step cost of himself. Taking the deal would lead to him forgetting everything about himself and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|his mother]] all of him would be gone and would start from scratch. upon hearing this Korrigan is on verge of tears and gives him the biggest hug and explains that he received a similar deal but he at least got to keep most of his memories. Mordecai start to weep and Korrigan comforts him by saying it ok, if you think about it we didn't even know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] existed a few weeks ago and they learnt so much since then, we can always learn about the dragon the old fashioned way.                                                                                                                                           |

Mordecai is very smug going into this room as he is aware, to an extent, of Chenris' soul. They enter the portal and are greeted with a room where books are floating everywhere. At the altar is a shimmering orb, very similar to the one in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s library. Mordecai walks up very cock and says hi, they reply in Mordecai's head. Mordecai has a few questions and wants chenris to know the answers. The orb agrees to broadcast their voice to both of them. He asks about chenris soul and the orb snarky remarks "Why does chenris want his soul back"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The orb tells him, that every creature has a soul which is a manifestation of that creature's very being. When someone dies their soul goes off to the afterlife, or the like, unless they are brought back to life with magic since it takes some time for the soul to travel off. The orb then says because you promised your soul to the goddess it's not there forever. If you die, there is no coming back. The orb theories that Aidan also can't be revived. chenris should be happy since he gets to research. Most gods don't make a pact like [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]. Most Gods allow souls to return with spells like [Revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify). He would assume Aidan would go to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] and Korrigan would eventually return to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. Chenris asks if he gets special privileges for being a part of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]]. The orb scoffs and says he gets the privilege to access all of the world's knowledge, for a price of course. Mordecai has gone white with shock while chenris seems ok, he says it's a good thing that he has no intention of dying any time soon, the orb laughs and says he said the same thing when he was alive and now he is here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
