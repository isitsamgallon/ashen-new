> "AND LO, AELORIA CAME FORTH CLOAKED IN radiant light, the Keeper of Knowledge, whose eyes beheld the secrets of the firmament. Around her did the holy tomes revolve, and her voice was as a thousand whispers of truth, guiding the faithful and forbidding the unworthy. " <cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Aeloria is a radiant, near-divine being who embodies the pursuit of understanding and the quiet power of truth. She appears as a serene, luminous figure surrounded by drifting books and soft light, moving through the world not as a conqueror, but as a guide. She exists in the spaces between thought and revelation, drawn to those who seek meaning, and offering glimpses of clarity to those willing to listen. 

### General Information
Living in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/The Golden Plane\|her grand library]]. She dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. She has no physical form in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], however, she often pulls people up to The Golden Plain to communicate with her directly, where she chooses to take the form of an elven woman wearing all white. 

She has a group of followers known as [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] who sign a pact with her on initiation, meaning that she gets their eternal soul to act as a researcher while they get whatever knowledge they may require.

Aeloria is seen as generally a good god who dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. However, she can also be quite cruel in what she asks for in return for knowledge, like when [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] visit her room in the [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|All-Father Temple]].

### Divine Attributes
 - Aeloria reigns over the divine domains of Light, Knowledge, Hope, and Enlightenment, each facet reflecting her eternal role as the guide of minds and the bearer of sacred truth. Her presence inspires clarity where there was once confusion, and warmth where there was despair.
 - Her symbol is a radiant sunburst cradling an open book at its heart, often accompanied by a golden quill encircled by a halo of light - emblems of revelation, learning, and divine inspiration made manifest.
 - The sacred colors of her worship are gold, white, and soft azure: gold for divine wisdom, white for purity of purpose, and azure for the serene depths of understanding.
 - Creatures held dear to her are the golden dove, a messenger of hope; the white stag, a silent guardian and beacon of guidance; and the luminous moth, ever-drawn to the light of hidden truths, fluttering at the threshold between ignorance and knowing.

### Mythos & legend
Aeloria is revered as the divine spark that illuminates shadowed minds and lost paths. She was born from [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] during an age when mortals cried out not only for healing, but for understanding. In answer to their pleas, [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] wept tears of starlight-tears that became Aeloria, a being of radiant insight. Where her brother [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would later embody the chaos of time, Aeloria arose as its guide, bringing order to its flow and meaning to its moments. 

She is the eternal teacher, the bearer of sacred truth, and the light at the edge of the unknown. Among her most beloved myths is the tale of an exiled tribe lost in a barren land. With no map but the stars above, it was Aeloria who came to them in silence, teaching them to read the night sky. Through her wisdom, they transformed desolation into abundance, and despair into purpose-a testament to her gift of knowledge as salvation. 

But Aeloria's light does not go unchallenged. Her twin in divine opposition is [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], her brother and rival, whose birth mirrored hers in timing but not in spirit. While she preserves, he unravels; while she brings clarity, he sows uncertainty. Their struggle echoes across [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|the Amber Realms]], influencing the fate of empires and the choices of mortals. It is said that whenever a great discovery is made, or a great lie exposed, their silent battle flares anew. 

Her most devoted followers, [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]], enter into a sacred pact-granted boundless knowledge in life, they pledge their eternal souls to her after death. In the radiant halls of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/The Golden Plane\|The Golden Plane]], they become eternal scholars, uncovering the truths of the cosmos within her celestial library. Yet even here, caution is whispered: one tale tells of a scholar who reached too far, unearthing forbidden knowledge and becoming lost in endless research, burdened by truths never meant for mortal minds. 

Aeloria is not merely a goddess of learning-she is its light. She does not demand worship, but invites seekers. In her presence, confusion gives way to clarity, and ignorance to revelation. And through her, the eternal question becomes a path, lit gently by stars. 

### Worship & Rituals
#### The illumination Festival 
This grand event takes place during the longest day of the year. Worshippers light countless lanterns and share tales of inspiration and triumph, symbolizing the spreading of knowledge and hope. The festival concludes with a communal vow to pursue truth in all endeavors. 

#### The Ascension of The Mind 
A meditative ritual involving starlight reflection in holy pools, symbolizing enlightenment. Devotees focus their minds on questions plaguing them, often emerging with newfound clarity attributed to Aeloria's blessings. 

#### The Oath of Light
Devotees take this sacred oath when joining her clergy or becoming Golden Ones. The initiation involves writing one's life goal on a golden parchment and burning it in her light, signifying surrender to her divine wisdom. 

### Artifacts & Relics
#### Tome of Radiance
A mystical book containing infinite pages, capable of revealing knowledge from any realm. Its inscriptions are written in shifting celestial languages. 

#### The Lantern of Eternal Guidence
A lantern that never extinguishes, offering light in the darkest places. It also reveals hidden truths. 

#### The Quill of illumination
A golden quill that writes truths yet untold, used by her highest priests to record prophecies and divine insights.

[[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] states that she will help the party get stronger ([[Level Up\|Level Up]]) as she is a fan of how much information she is getting out of the party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | Chenris and Aidan went to Aeloria’s temple and Chenris was offered the exact location of the wizard in exchange for him not remembering where he was from. Chenris renegotiated with the Goddess for a more general location of where Terrance was in exchange for his knowledge of his family home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Chenris remained silent as they pressed onward, his mind burdened by fragmented memories of his dream and the haunting revelations it had uncovered. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] ’s words echoed in his thoughts, cutting deeper than any wound from the goblins. Mordecai, ever attuned to the emotional undercurrents around him, kept a watchful eye on the elf, refraining from prying but ready to offer his irreverent support when needed. Meanwhile, Drache’s steadfast presence provided a sense of stability to the group, even as his stern admonishments reminded them of the dangers of carelessness in their chaotic lives.                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Chenris rejected the offer and disappeared, finding himself in the presence of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], the Goddess of Light and Knowledge. She offered him the means to dispel the ancient goblin magic in exchange for a portion of his magical abilities. Accepting the deal, Chenris returned to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], dispelling the magic and saving Kal. [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], amused and intrigued by the group, warned them that the cost of retrieving the missing child would rise with each passing day. With their encounter resolved, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] regrouped, the weight of Chenris’ decision and the looming threat of the gods shaping their next steps as they prepared to delve deeper into their perilous journey. |
