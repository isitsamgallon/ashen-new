> "AND LO, THOSE WHO SOUGHT THE LIGHT DID walk the fields of gold, where thought knew no end and truth bloomed without root. In the halls of glass they laboured, not in toil, but in reverence-for knowledge was their altar, and revelation their reward."" <cite> Book of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], Verse 17 :4 </cite>

### Overview
The Golden Plane is the divine realm of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], a radiant afterlife where knowledge is eternal and the pursuit of truth never ends. It stretches infinitely Beneath a sky of shifting constellations- each star a concept, memory, or forgotten truth waiting to be rediscovered. The land itself is serene and ordered: vast Fields of golden grass ripple with unseen winds, whispering lessons to those who listen. Rivers of liquid light wind through crystalline valleys, flowing with divine inspiration and pure thought. Trees bear fruit that grants fleeting glimpses into hidden wisdom, but Each bite poses a question in return.

At the centre of this plane stands the Celestial Archive, A sprawling tower-library of light and glass, its corridors Endless and ever-shifting. Within its walls, [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]], souls who pledged themselves to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] in life labour As scholars, researchers, and archivists. They are Not bound by chains, but by purpose, each devoted to uncovering truths too vast for the mortal mind. Here, The boundaries of time blur; a single moment can Stretch into years of contemplation, and a lifetime's Worth of insight can be drawn from a single word.

The Golden Plane is a place of peace and clarity, but not Without its burdens. The endless pursuit of truth can be Isolating, and some scholars lose themselves in their Studies, unravelled by the weight of knowledge never Meant for mortal comprehension. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] herself walks The halls at times, offering guidance to those who stray Too far, and watching over her faithful with a gaze as Warm as it is piercing.

While beautiful and luminous, the Golden P lane is no Paradise of leisure. It is a sacred crucible of thought, Where devotion to truth replaces rest, and where light does not always comfort, but always reveals.

### Description
The library is impossibly big and houses an untold number of books and ancient wisdoms. The air hums faintly with arcane energy, carrying the faint scent of aged parchment, ink, and a hint of ozone. The light is soft and golden, emanating from floating orbs that drift lazily through the chambers, casting no shadows.

Despite its serene beauty, the library exudes an unsettling aura. Whispers drift through the halls, indistinct murmurs of ancient scholars, forgotten memories, and perhaps the library itself. The whispers seem to respond to the thoughts of the visitors as if the library is alive and aware of their presence.

The shelves themselves defy mortal understanding. Some are impossibly tall, extending upward into ceilings that fade into a starry void. Others are compact and intimate, shaped like spirals or crescents, encouraging personal discovery. There are sections where books float freely, orbiting around glowing pedestals, while others are stacked neatly in glass cases that open only at the touch of the worthy.
