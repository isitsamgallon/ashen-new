> "AND ELDROS STOOD AMIDST THE GOLDEN FIELDS, The Reaper of Seasons, whose scythe moved in circles Unbroken. He who sows in silence and reaps with Wisdom, turning the wheel of life and death by divine Ordinance, his plates spinning with the fates of men. " <cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Eldros is a towering, ageless figure who tends the Endless fields of existence, his scythe moving in slow, Deliberate arcs. He is not a god of death, but of turning - The quiet rhythm of beginnings and endings. Seasons Pass in his shadow, and all cycles, whether of harvest or
Heartbreak, eventually come under his care. He speaks Little, but in his silence, all things grow or return.

### General Information
While his dominion may seem similar to that of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who governs time, the crucial difference is that Eldros oversees everything—life, death, decay, growth, prosperity, and famine. His divine role is to maintain the natural order of the world, ensuring that each of these fundamental aspects continues in harmony.

When Eldros manifests, he often appears as a juggler spinning multiple plates, each representing a vital force of existence. If any of these plates falter, it is his duty to set them spinning again, preventing imbalance. Originally, Eldros also oversaw the realm of dreams, but due to the unpredictable nature of that domain, he found it difficult to maintain alongside the waking world. To resolve this, he created his daughter, [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], entrusting her with the governance of dreams so he could focus solely on reality.

Despite holding dominion over life and death, Eldros cannot kill a god, as deities exist beyond the natural order he controls. The priest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] explaining this concept clarifies that gods typically reside in their own domains, making them immune to each other’s influence. Even when they manifest in the mortal world, they do so as mere aspects of themselves, meaning that destroying such an aspect does not harm the true god. Additionally, Eldros is unique among the gods in that he has no known Heralds to act as his intermediaries.

### Divine Attributes
- Eldros is the quiet guardian of Nature, Balance, Equilibrium, Renewal, and Preservation. He Embodies the steady rhythm of the natural world restoring Harmony where life overreaches and Protecting the fragile balance that sustains all things.
- His symbols reflect this role: a scale entwined with Vines, a perfect circle of stone and moss, and an Evergreen tree with evenly spread roots and Branches- each a testament to balance and Continuity.
- The sacred colours of his worship are green, white, And earthy brown-green for vitality, white for clarity, And brown for the enduring strength of the earth. - Creatures sacred to Eldros include the stag, ever watchful In the wild; the turtle, a symbol of patience and longevity; the owl, keeper of ancient woodland Wisdom; and the white rabbit, a quiet spirit of Gentleness and seasonal renewal.

### Mythos & Legends
Eldros, god of Balance, Nature, and Preservation, is the Quiet fulcrum upon which [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|the Amber Realms]] turn. Born Not in violence or sorrow, but in stillness at the world's First breath, he emerged as the embodiment of harmony, a force neither passive nor aggressive, but ever Vigilant. While others vie for power, Eldros endures, Holding the cosmic scales steady even as creation shifts.

Among mortals, he is revered by farmers, hunters, and Herbalists, who offer simple prayers for balance in the Cycle of life. Yet his answers are few, for Eldros does not Grant favour-he restores equilibrium. The gods Themselves see him as a neutral arbiter in their Conflicts, though his decisions often come without Warning, and with consequences only understood in Hindsight.

A popular myth known as The Great Juggle describes Eldros as a celestial juggler, forever keeping countless Plates spinning-each plate a symbol of opposing forces: Life and death, abundance and scarcity, decay and Renewal. Mortals and deities alike, in their ambition or
Carelessness, threaten to topple his delicate rhythm. Yet Still he juggles, tireless and unwavering, for to let even One fall would bring imbalance to all.

Of all his creations, Eldros holds greatest pride in [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], goddess of Dreams and Memories. Wishing To entrust the ephemeral realm of slumber to another, He formed her from the quiet space between waking Thought and sleeping vision. Their bond is one of deep Respect, [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] tends to the dreamscape while Eldros maintains the waking world, each supporting the Other in unseen but vital ways.

Eldros does not seek worship, only understanding. He is Not the loudest god, nor the most visible, but in every Turn of the seasons and every moment of quiet stillness, His hand can be felt- balancing, restoring, enduring.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | With that out of the way, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] continued on and found a multifaith church. The building was old and rotting, and the inside wasn't much better, as it was completely empty and dilapidated. On the far end were 4 altars. One was dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and the last to [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]. They approached the altar and laid the lavender on it. They all turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked him to pray. After doing so, the lavender vanished, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] felt a rush of strange energy wash over them. As [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the one to pray, he immediately knew that this was a boon from [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and would allow them to sleep anywhere and not fear the consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | With everything settled, the group had no reason to stay in the room and bid their farewells to the orb. As they were leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] spell on [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] and ⚔️ [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]'s voices they said, "Glad to see you're not a hypocrite" [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] momentarily stopped in their tracks as the rest walked past him out of the room. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was the last to leave, shooting them a quick glance before leaving as well. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] soon joined them as they decided that it might be best if they went into 🏛️ [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' room next as none of them knew anything about the god, and it would be a great chance for them to learn some new information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | After going through the door, they found themselves in a massive wheat field. In the middle, a man wearing a large hood was working the fields with an impossibly large scythe. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] approached the man, who sat on a large log as they talked. The man asked if they wanted or needed anything from him, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that they had come to learn about [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] and figured this would be the best place to do so. As the man spoke, he never looked up and revealed his face, instead opting to look at the floor as he spoke. He explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] was the god that ensured the world kept spinning and all things remained as they were. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tilted their head in confusion, saying that this sounded a lot like [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. The priest admitted that when put like that, they did sound quite similar, but there was one key difference: [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] held dominion over time, whereas [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] held dominion over everything. He ensured that the world kept spinning, people kept being born, and everyone kept dying. [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] ensured that the natural order of the world was maintained. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | Most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] remained confused, so the priest explained that when [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] chose to manifest, he would often do so as a juggler spinning many plates. Each of these plates could be seen as a natural part of life: Life, death, decay, growth, prosperity and famine. Each of these plates is necessary for the universe to function properly, and it was [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' job to ensure each of these plates kept spinning. If they ever stopped, he made sure they began to spin again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | The priest went on to explain that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] used to look after the dreaming world as well, but he struggled to keep track because the rules were different. He still had to maintain balance over the waking parts of the universe. After a few instances of things going wrong, the god decided it would be best to create someone who would watch over the sleeping world while he focused on the waking world. This caused him to give birth to his daughter, whom he named [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asks that if [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] has the power over life and death, then could he thematically kill a God? The priest explained that although [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] controlled the force of life and death, the gods were above such concepts and transcended the natural order, causing them to be outside of [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' powers. He explained that most gods also lived in their own domains and, as such, could not be influenced by other gods. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked that if they were to come to the mortal realm, then could [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] kill them. The priest explained that when the gods manifest on the world, they do so by pushing their essence through a pinhole, and the manifestation wasn't truly them, just an aspect of them. Killing this aspect would not affect the actual god[^1]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] had any known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s, to which the priest explained that he didn't. With all their questions answered, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] thanked the man for his time and answered and left the room and returned to tending the fields.                                                                            |
