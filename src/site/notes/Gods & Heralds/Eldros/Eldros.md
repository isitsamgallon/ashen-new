> "AND ELDROS STOOD AMIDST THE GOLDEN FIELDS, The Reaper of Seasons, whose scythe moved in circles Unbroken. He who sows in silence and reaps with Wisdom, turning the wheel of life and death by divine Ordinance, his plates spinning with the fates of men. " <cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Eldros is a towering, ageless figure who tends the Endless fields of existence, his scythe moving in slow, Deliberate arcs. He is not a god of death, but of turning - The quiet rhythm of beginnings and endings. Seasons Pass in his shadow, and all cycles, whether of harvest or
Heartbreak, eventually come under his care. He speaks Little, but in his silence, all things grow or return.

### General Information
While his dominion may seem similar to that of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who governs time, the crucial difference is that Eldros oversees everything—life, death, decay, growth, prosperity, and famine. His divine role is to maintain the natural order of the world, ensuring that each of these fundamental aspects continues in harmony.

When Eldros manifests, he often appears as a juggler spinning multiple plates, each representing a vital force of existence. If any of these plates falter, it is his duty to set them spinning again, preventing imbalance. Originally, Eldros also oversaw the realm of dreams, but due to the unpredictable nature of that domain, he found it difficult to maintain alongside the waking world. To resolve this, he created his daughter, [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], entrusting her with the governance of dreams so he could focus solely on reality.

Despite holding dominion over life and death, Eldros cannot kill a god, as deities exist beyond the natural order he controls. The priest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] explaining this concept clarifies that gods typically reside in their own domains, making them immune to each other’s influence. Even when they manifest in the mortal world, they do so as mere aspects of themselves, meaning that destroying such an aspect does not harm the true god. Additionally, Eldros is unique among the gods in that he has no known Heralds to act as his intermediaries.

Among mortals, he is revered by farmers, hunters, and Herbalists, who offer simple prayers for balance in the Cycle of life.

A popular myth known as The Great Juggle describes Eldros as a celestial juggler, forever keeping countless Plates spinning-each plate a symbol of opposing forces: Life and death, abundance and scarcity, decay and Renewal. Mortals and deities alike, in their ambition or
Carelessness, threaten to topple his delicate rhythm. Yet Still he juggles, tireless and unwavering, for to let even One fall would bring imbalance to all.
