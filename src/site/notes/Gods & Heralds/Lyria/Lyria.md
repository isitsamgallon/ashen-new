> "AND BEHOLD, LYRIA CAME FORTH AS THE FLAME of Yearning, clothed in the perfume of twilight and crowned with the blush of first Jove. Her breath stirred hearts to longing, and her touch awakened the slumbering soul. She is the Whisper in the garden, the Sacred Temptation, the covenant of pleasure and pain for in her embrace is both ecstasy and ruin, and many are they who fall willingly."<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Lyria is a soft, sensual force who moves through the world as a sigh in the dark - a tender whisper in moments of longing. She is the embodiment of love in all its forms: aching, euphoric, and ruinous. Draped in twilight hues and surrounded by the scent of memory,
she appears where desire lingers and hearts falter, not to claim, but to awaken. She is not salvation, but the ache that makes one reach for it.

- Lyria is the goddess of Love, Passion, Desire, Seduction, Unity, and Betrayal- a divine
embodiment of both intimacy and intrigue. She is the thrill of connection and the sting of heartbreak, guiding mortals through the ecstasy and peril of longing.

- The sacred colors of her worship are crimson red, silver, and deep violet-crimson for burning passion, silver for elegance and allure, and violet for the shadows that linger in intimacy.
- Creatures sacred to Lyria are drawn from both the tender and the treacherous: swans who embody graceful devotion, silver-eyed cats known to charm and vanish, and velvet-winged serpents whose hypnotic gaze stirs longing and temptation alike.
