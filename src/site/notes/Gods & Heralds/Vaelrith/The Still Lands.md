> "WHEN ALL VOICES FALL SILENT AND THE LAST breath fades, the road shall end in the StiJJJands. There, beneath the watch of stone and ash, even the forgotten shall be remembered, and death shall speak only in whispers." <cite> The Final Litany, Verse 1:1</cite>

### Overview
The realm of [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]], god of Death, Silence, Endings, and Memory, is known as the Still Lands-a vast, eternal graveyard stretching endlessly beneath a sky of dim gold and muted grey. The land is quiet and soft beneath one's feet, covered in grey grasses, mossy stone, and rows upon rows of graves, mausoleums, and crumbling statues. Nothing stirs without purpose. Wind  moves only when it needs to. Time here does not pass it settles.

At the center of this endless necropolis stands the Mansion of the Last Breath, an impossibly vast and ancient estate rising from bone-white earth and ash. Constructed from midnight stone and tarnished brass, the mansion's architecture bends and shifts, its corridors reshaping themselves with quiet purpose. Within its echoing halls are countless hourglasses, each tracking the life of a soul in the living world. Their sands fall in strange rhythms-some slow and serene, others in rapid collapse-marking the passing of lives great and small.

Elsewhere in the mansion, strands of memory are woven into the walls like glimmering veins, pulsing softly with the weight of final words, forgotten names, and last breaths. These memories are not kept for judgment, but for remembrance-preserved by the realm itself when no one else remains to hold them.

[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] once walked these halls, a silent custodian of endings who guided each passing soul with quiet grace. But now, he is gone-imprisoned by those who feared the final truth he represents. His mansion stands unruled, tended only by the psychopomps, his robed and
faceless servants who continue their duties in eerie silence. They maintain the graves, wind the clocks, and gently usher wandering souls to rest-carrying out his will even in his absence.

The Stilllands offer no paradise, no punishment-only peace. Every grave here has a story, every silence a weight. To step foot in this realm is to understand that all things must end-and that even endings deserve to be remembered.
