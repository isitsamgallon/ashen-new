> "AND AT THE SETTING OF ALL THINGS CAME Vaelrith, the Stillness Beyond, the Crown of Death, upon whom time dare not lay its hand. Cloaked in silence and crowned with bone, he walks not in wrath, but in solemn promise- for to each living breath, he is the Amen. The stars falter in his passing, and the earth yields without protest, for his hand is gentle and final. He is the keeper of endings, the last word in the book of days."<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Vaelrith is a solemn, silent figure who waits at the edge of all things. He is not a reaper, but a witness - the one who stands still when all else falls away. Cloaked in stillness and crowned in endings, he does not demand reverence, only acceptance. Where he walks, stories close and voices fade, but not without meaning. He is the last page, turned with grace.

### General Information
[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] is the ancient God of death and decay. Not many know of the God's existence, much like [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], but those who do say that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] must've heave existed before [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] otherwise there would be no concept of death that would end [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. He is known to be worshiped by [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|Vampire]]s. 

It was mentioned that at some point [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was 'captured' and that is why there are solely fragments of the God left. 

### Divine Attributes
- Vaelrith is the god of Death, Silence, Endings, Memory, and the Afterlife- a solemn figure who watches over the final breath and the quiet that follows. Neither cruel nor kind, he is the stillness at the end of all things, and the keeper of stories no longer told.
- His symbols are steeped in finality: a bell without a clapper, tolling only in spirit; a withered flower sealed in glass; and a skull crowned with a circlet of bone- each a reminder that all must pass.
- The sacred colours of his worship are bone white, shadow black, and muted gold- white for the pale touch of death, black for the silence it brings, and gold for the memories preserved beyond the grave. 
- Creatures sacred to Vaelrith include grave-haunting moths that flutter between realms, pallid crows that deliver final omens, and robed psychopomp spirits who guide souls with bells that ring only for the dead.

### Mythos & Legends
Vaelrith, god of Death, Silence, Endings, and Memory, is among the first beings to exist-born in tandem with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the primordial whole. When the first moment reached its last, it was Vaelrith who laid a silent hand upon [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], ending its existence and giving birth to all creation. In that act, death became not destruction, but the sacred doorway through which all things begin and end.

He has always been a quiet god, revered not for power, but for presence. Death under Vaelrith's gaze is not cruel-it is restful, necessary, and unchanging. Yet mortals have long feared him. In a forgotten age, a cult known as The Shrouded Rebirth sought to stop death
altogether. Believing themselves wise, they lured Vaelrith into a crypt of their own making and sealed him there with ancient rites, imagining a world freed from his touch.

But without death, life decayed. Suffering lingered, and time lost meaning. [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]], guardian of balance, assumed the burden Vaelrith left behind, restoring the cycle of life and loss. The cult that had imprisoned him slowly perished- unageing, yet unravelling- proving that death is not an end to be feared, but a mercy to be honoured. 

One tale that endures is The Bell That Rang Once, telling of a city that magically defied death. When rot and madness overcame it, a single, soundless bell tolled across the land. In that moment, death returned- not in fury, but in peace- and the people were allowed to rest.
Vaelrith remains silent in his imprisonment, yet his essence is still felt. His faceless psychopomps continue to guide souls, their presence marked by stillness and calm. He does not demand offerings, nor does he grant favours- but he is always watching, always waiting.

To know Vaelrith is to understand that endings are not erasures, but closures. He is the keeper of the last page, the guardian of memory, and the promise that even in silence, we are not forgotten.

### Worship & Rituals 
#### The Bell OF Passing
When someone dies, mourners ring a small, tongueless
bell once in silence to honor Vaelrith and mark the
soul's journey. The act is believed to draw a
psychopomp's attention to gently guide the departed
beyond.

#### The Last Candle 
A single candle is lit beside the dying or in places of
remembrance. When it burns out, it symbolizes
acceptance of the end and Vaelrith's watchful presence.
Temples often keep one continuously burning in honor
of all unnamed dead.

#### THe Rite OF Remembering 
Once a year, followers gather to speak the names of the
departed aloud, one by one. No sermons, only memory.
It is said that those remembered in this way rest more
peacefully, their stories safely preserved by Vaelrith.


### Artifacts & Relics
#### The Bell Without Sound
A small bell of blackened gold with no clapper. When
held at the moment of death, it ensures the soul passes
peacefully and cannot be bound or raised. It is said the
bell rings only for Vaelrith- and only in silence.

#### The Shroud Of Finality
A faded black burial cloth once laid over a saint of
Vaelrith. When draped over the dying or dead, it
prevents unnatural resurrection and wards off undead
nearby.

#### The Memory Coin
A tarnished silver coin used in ancient funerary rites.
Placing it on the tongue of the deceased allows them to
whisper one final truth to the living- only once, and only
to one listener.

### Notable Information 
- [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was first encounter by [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]] when a funeral carriage made of bones and ancient looking worshipers stopped at [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] and asked them to wring the bell. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]  ended up ringing the bell causing the coffin, the worshippers and the carriage to disintegrate and the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|Fragment Of Vaelrith]] jumped into [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's body. They were soon saved by [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|Vampire]] s until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave birth to the new [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]] | Since [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]'s rebirth, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] felt... whole again, a realisation that they had neither the energy nor the desire to investigate further had. Instead, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] posed the question of whether going to the place that had lost all of its food supplies was truly the best idea, especially since they had all been spotted in the town just before everything went missing. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] agreed that it was probably best to skip the Fairest Post and head straight for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]].                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | With a kind smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that if they told them that, she could come into the dome. She nodded and said their God was called '[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]', and he was an ancient god. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if they were related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], and the women explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was much older than Aetheorion. Entering the doom and sitting down, she explained that for Aetheorion, the God of life, to die, the concept of death needed to exist. [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was that concept. Kerrigan began to say they were good friends of the Terathera, but the women didn't seem to care. |
