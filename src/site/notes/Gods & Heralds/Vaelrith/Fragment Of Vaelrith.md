### Overview
In [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38]] when a funeral carriage made of bones and ancient looking worshipers stopped at the party and asked them to wring the bell. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]  ended up ringing the bell causing the coffin, the worshippers and the carriage to disintegrate and the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|Fragment Of Vaelrith]] jumped into [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's body. They were soon saved by [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|Vampire]] s until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave birth to the new [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | It turned its eyeless sockets toward [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], and in a voice that chilled bone, the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|Fragment Of Vaelrith]] whispered: "Father... Please hand me the bell."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], dazed and twitching, reached into their satchel with a trembling hand. Without understanding why, they placed the bell in the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|creature's]] waiting palm. “Thank you,” the figure said, almost politely. Then it looked up toward the sky. The wind died in an instant. Not even the leaves rustled. And just like that, it was gone, vanished into nothing. The world held its breath. |
