This was an ancient ritual that could be used to banish [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. To perform this ritual, the afflicted must burn 8 of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Pages\|The Pages]] along with their most prized possession. Everyone must then close their eyes and not open them until they hear three rings of a bell. 

Here is a list of what each party member burnt during their ritual:
- [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] threw in the key that he had used to escape the cult he had been holding since his birth. 
- [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] Placed a worn-out short sword offering it to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Sera ‡\|Sera ‡]] and stepped back, tears littering his face. 
- [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] burnt [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle Reverence †]]'s cloak.
- [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] puts a hastily written note with an unsolved problem. (This is a fake and will ultimately cause the ritual to fail)
- [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] Ripped [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] emblem from this shirt, kissing it and determined that he would find who he was missing.

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] originally discovered the ritual during a raid on [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]]. where they found a book on the subject in the cults library ([[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Page From Unnamed Book found the Black Cult's Hideout\|Page From Unnamed Book found the Black Cult's Hideout]]).
