### Overview
[[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who takes children and drains them of their remaining years to give to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. He presides over [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], where he spends a lot of his time watching the realms and waiting for the end of time. After completing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]], for the first time, it was revealed that the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] was once the Second-born child of the family [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] met while searching for [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Pages\|The Pages]]. 

### The Herald's Story
The man explains that he used to live in a place known as [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]], a place to the north that was extremely cold and unforgiving. They wanted to move somewhere warmer to raise their family. The man reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|the Emperor]] of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] invited people to come settle in this land they are in, however, the only way to get there is to sail with [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]]. This fleet of pirates took most of their [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] and treated them like filth, with them nearly dying many times. Halfway through the journey, the ship encountered a storm that threatened to snap the vessel in two. In a desperate bid to survive, they made a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. In exchange for their second-born's life, they would be guaranteed safe passage to the OFC. The family, weak and mentally broken, foolishly accepted God's tantalising offer. They arrived safe enough but as they stepped foot on the land now known as the OFC, they watched in horror as the wife's belly started to radiate black smoke. With [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]’ laughter as a backing track, the woman's baby disappeared, claimed by the cruel God.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s corpse becomes quiet.                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] suddenly awoke from a deep sleep, everything felt incredibly wrong. He quickly checked on [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]], who seemed fine until he realised she wasn't moving, in fact, nothing around him was moving and it was all dead quiet. He quickly jumped out of bed, grabbing his great axe, he ran outside to find everyone was still around but frozen midway through going about their daily lives. There were even birds hovering motionless in the sky. Drache gripped his GreatAxe tightly before focusing his breath and used [Detect Good and Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good) to see if he could figure out what was happening to him. In this heightened state he realised that this was very similar to the feeling of walking through [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] during their fight with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. With that realisation, he had the sudden and urgent need to leave Uvam. He rushes back inside to write a note to Emmeline: "Something is wrong, I have to leave, be safe my love." He stabs the note into the door before donning his armour and leaving [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Aidan is just as happy to him and exclaims how great it is to finally not be alone when time freezes. Drache is confused and so explains how a similar thing happened when everyone was infiltrating the Tulan Fort. However, the time when he met up with everyone time didn't resume and this time there was a black mist that he had been following. His sentence began to railer off as he noticed that the black mist was crowding around drache's feet. But when asked, the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] was unable to see it. As they're talking, they sense some movement coming from behind but are unable to figure out where it is coming from. They turn back to face each other to ask if they noticed anything but neither had any ideas and figured it must be part of all of it. They hear a faint reselling from behind them, however, when they turn around all of the trees around them look like they have died and all their leaves have fallen off. Clinging onto the side of one the tallest trees was [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Suddenly a wooden tentacle shot out of the ground at the slashing Aidan but missing Drache as he was able to dodge out of the way. They both try looking away from the monster, hoping that it will go away like the last few times. after waiting for a little bit they check again, only to find it significantly closer to them. Aidan calls for Drache to get into the cart so they can try and escape it. They both clamber on and begin to race away. Drache asks if there's a way to kill or hurt it. Aidan thinks back but realises that in the Black Forest, [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]] is unkillable, meaning their best option is to run away. Even with the carriage moving at full speed, [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]] seemed to easily keep up with them, firing wooden tentacles at the cart, slowly taking off small chunks as they kept running. As they leave Uvam, a bright white light suddenly appears in front of them, and with no other options, they race into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 18\|Session 18]]          | Meanwhile, Aidan starts thinking more about his procession and inevitable the fact that he is being hunted by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]]. Suddenly, it appears next to Aidan. He manages to look away before taking any damage and starts to have a panic attack and curls in a ball.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

He make some headway when [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]] appears infront of him. Mordecai is now looking him in it's not face. recognising it immediately he looks away. Mordecai decides to use message to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the haunter]] and says "leave, there are easier pray elsewhere".

Chenris himself is confused why he did it since again its not a logical thing to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Korrigan, ever the propionate of free will, is left to stew in his frustration over being forced to do something against his will. That and the ongoing frustration of not knowing who the trait of the group is, springs to action. Interrupting the group's strategy meeting, he declares he knows how to find the betrayer in their ranks and uses his fey pact to summon [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek The Wise]] to his aid. Upon realising what is happening Merek starts to profusely sweat with worry and fear and timidly asks what is required of him. With a manic laugh, he tells Merek that if he uncovers who is responsible for failing the ritual and not banishing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], then is free of his debt. Merek is frozen in fear before being hurried off to do his job. Satisfied with the results of his actions he turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and asks what preparation for the war need to be done. A moment of hesitation, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] gets back to explaining the the dire situation the OFC is in. Even with [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]] troupes, they are still out numbered at least 5 to 1. The Dawn has more airships, warships and heavy duty weaponry at their disposal as well. She also makes note that even though the OFC does have access to ships and airships, these are all small and/or merchant vessels meaning if they are all lost then their nation will be crippled in their trade capabilities after the war, even if they were to win. |

As they are traveling through the rolling hills of The Dawn, Aidan spots a mysterious black figure off in the distance. Drawn in he recognises the creature's uncanny lack of face and the familiar pain of looking at [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] too long. Aidan, who had been becoming more and more unstable with matters related to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and his [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|black cult]] immediately yelled in fear and looked away and suffered the penalty to his memory and forgot.

Before looking away to save his mind from the psychic punishment of the beast. Now consciously aware of the danger and where it is, the group strategise on how to deal with their predicament. Chenris remembers one of their battles in [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] and tells everyone to close their eyes and ignore the beast.

Angered Korrigan devises a scheme to route out the traitor, he suggest to the group that if he charms people one by one then he can exonerate people quickly and reliably as they would be unable to lie to him. Drache volunteers to go first before Mordecai is able to point how unethical this plan is. Chenris, who had be uncharacteristically silent since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the haunter]] had retreated, joined in on the chorus of dissatisfaction. Korrigan immediately becomes suspicious as in his mind, this is a simple and easy way to determine the traitor and if people are against it then they must have secrets they wish to hide. Mordecai counters by pointing out the fact that Korrigan could be the one responsible and he cannot charm himself. Korrigan agrees and offers to be put under the command spell from Chenris to be checked out himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Inside the mansion, they encountered a spectral old man clutching a page and an infant’s decayed body. Using illusions, Mordecai tricked him into relinquishing the page, but the man’s anguish summoned [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]]. The battle was brutal; [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]]’s incorporeal form resisted their attacks, and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] fell to its tendrils, his screams echoing through the cursed halls.

Weary but resolute, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] moved forward, knowing their perilous quest to banish [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]] was far from over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
