>"AND FROM THE BREACH IN THE FABRIC OF TIME came the Chronovorus, the Eater of Days, whose form was not fixed, and whose hunger knew no end. He passed unseen through ages, devouring what was and what might be, until even memory turned to dust." <cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Chronovorus is a shifting, formless being born of Broken time, a presence that slips through cracks in Causality and memory. It does not speak, only consumes - Eras, events, and identities vanishing in its wake. To Witness it is to feel moments unravel, as if the world Itself forgets its own story. It does not hunger out of Malice, but simply because it exists where time no Longer holds meaning.

### General Information
**The Temporal Harbinger, Bringer of Chaos.** Although he dedicates most of his time to using his powers to sow chaos across [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] for his own amusement, he is also responsible for maintaining the flow of time and keeping it moving forward at the correct speed. He often makes pacts with mortals, with his most common pact being to take parts of their lifespans in exchange for help with a problem or strength. He often appears in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], choosing to take the form of a cloud of black smoke with nothing but a creepy smile levitating in it, halting time when he does appear. He also causes time rifts to open across the Amber Realm, which bleeds time, causing chaos and agony wherever they appear. 

He has devotees in the form of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]] who perform sacrifices on random people and give their remaining lifespans to the God. He has a few heralds who help to spread his influence, though his main one is [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], who takes children and drains them of their remaining years to give to Chronovorus. He presides over [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], where he spends a lot of his time watching the realms and waiting for the end of time.

### Divine Attributes
- Chronovorus rules over the volatile domains of Time, Chaos, Destruction, Entropy, and Manipulation. He Embodies the inevitable decay of all things and the Unravelling of order, where time fractures and spirals Into uncertainty, and nothing remains fixed for long. 
- His symbols are a shattered hourglass bleeding away Time, a spiral fractal hinting at infinite, chaotic paths, And a clock face stripped of its hands- a chilling Emblem of time unbound. 
- The sacred colours of his worship are black, dark Violet, and shimmering silver: black for the void Between moments, violet for the turbulence of Disorder, and silver for the glint of unrealized Potential.
- Creatures sacred to him include ethereal serpents That slip through time's current, and shadow crows Whose presence heralds disruption, decay, and the Slow collapse of reality.

### Mythos & Legends
Chronovorus, god of Time, Chaos, and Entropy, is a Divine paradox-born not of destruction, but of Compassion. From the heart of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], goddess of Mercy and Fate, he was brought into being during a Moment of cosmic sorrow, forged from her silent grief
At witnessing the unchanging suffering of mortals. In Seeking to ease their burdens, she birthed time itself only To find that its flow could not be contained. Thus, Chronovorus emerged: a god who saw not the mercy in Order, but the freedom in unravelling.

From his first breath, he was captivated by time's wild Beauty, choosing to sever it from predictability and turn It into a force of disruption. To Chronovorus, time is a Canvas best left unfinished, full of potential when Unbound. He exists to twist, to tangle, and to remind
Creation that nothing is eternal-not even the gods.

One legend recounts how he fractured the timeline of a Once-great empire. With a thought, he opened temporal Rifts across their lands-aging cities into dust while Others regressed to their dawn. The empire collapsed in Confusion, its people splintered into rival ages, unable to Recognize kin or cause. Today, their broken remnants Still shimmer across time, caught in cycles they cannot Escape.

A tale told with both awe and warning is that of the Emerald Swan, an artifact created by a mortal sorcerer Who begged Chronovorus for eternal life. Amused, the God granted his wish-but bound the man's lifespan to Those around him. Though long-lived, each bearer
Suffered cruel and ironic ends, their longevity a hollow Curse. In this, Chronovorus revealed his truth: time is a Gift best left unasked for.

His relationship with his sister, [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], goddess of Light and Knowledge, is one of eternal opposition. Where she seeks to preserve and illuminate, he seeks to Obscure and undo. Their divine conflict is written into The bones of the world- into the rise and fall of empires,
The flicker of stars, and the split-second choices that Shape mortal fate.

Yet Chronovorus is not evil- only inevitable. He is the Reminder that all things change, that endings come, and That from every unravelling, something strange and new Might emerge. Born of mercy, he became chaos Incarnate- and in his wake, the world continues to turn.

### Worship & Rituals

This dark ceremony involves the abduction of children, Whose life essence is drained by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] And transferred to Chronovorus. The ritual strengthens His dominion over time and chaos, perpetuating his Cycle of destruction

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]]              | With that out of the way, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] continued on and found a multifaith church. The building was old and rotting, and the inside wasn't much better, as it was completely empty and dilapidated. On the far end were 4 altars. One was dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and the last to [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]. They approached the altar and laid the lavender on it. They all turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked him to pray. After doing so, the lavender vanished, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] felt a rush of strange energy wash over them. As [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the one to pray, he immediately knew that this was a boon from [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and would allow them to sleep anywhere and not fear the consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | Before he could respond, she clicked her fingers, and an image materialized in the air. The vision was hard to look at, as if it broke the very rules of reality, but it clearly depicted his hand in the destruction of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|the Tower of Ishnmel]]. He watched in horror as his body became slowly overtaken by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], ultimately floating into the air and causing various large time rifts throughout [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]]. The sight was chilling, especially since he had never witnessed the destruction he caused from this perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | The judge called for silence in the court with a dismissive hand before diving straight into the proceedings, listing the crimes of [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]]: murder, theft, breaking and entering, international terrorism, racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder... The list went on and on, and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]'s smile never wavered. He seemed to take each charge as a point of pride. When the judge finally finished reading his extensive list, he looked at [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] as a teacher might look at a student caught cheating on a test. "How do you plead, boy?" he asked. "Guilty," Aiden replied meekly. The judge slowly raised his gavel high in the air, and as he did so, Aiden stole a glance at the God of Chaos, whose smile faltered for the first time, dissolving into disdain. Aiden didn’t even hear the mighty bang of the gavel; instead, his final moments were filled with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] snarking, “Coward.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Running onto the streets, they found a possessed [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], who must have snuck away at some point when entering the city, now possessed by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who was firing beams of energy aimed to kill as many people as possible with at least a dozen already dead around him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Aidan explains that they were viewed as an experiment by their parents, who were members of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]], cultivating a sense of anger concerning their past, especially as their life has now become intertwined with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In the middle, a man wearing a large hood was working the fields with an impossibly large scythe. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] approached the man, who sat on a large log as they talked. The man asked if they wanted or needed anything from him, and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that they had come to learn about [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] and figured this would be the best place to do so. As the man spoke, he never looked up and revealed his face, instead opting to look at the floor as he spoke. He explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] was the god that ensured the world kept spinning and all things remained as they were. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tilted their head in confusion, saying that this sounded a lot like [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. The priest admitted that when put like that, they did sound quite similar, but there was one key difference: [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] held dominion over time, whereas [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] held dominion over everything. He ensured that the world kept spinning, people kept being born, and everyone kept dying.

Along the way Chenris spots a black bear and its cub and notifies the party, reminding everyone how dangerous bears are when it comes to their cubs. Korrigan casts [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship) but gets countered and he thinks the bear is ok and doesn't mean any harm and in fact, he should go pet them.

Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | Korrigan quickly gets distracted when he realises Drache hasn't seen his new [Wild Shape](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_shape) ability and quickly transforms into a large horse. Drache is impressed and tries to pick it up but the horse is way too heavy for him. Mordecai gets them back on track, as they think everything, including this weird spell at Dawnhaven, is the work of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]] and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. At this, Korrigan says "Chronohorsey" only drache can understand as he is able to understand animals. Transforming back into a Humanoid, korrigan tries his best to remember all of these old Thieves' paths into and out of the city. One of them is fairly close, and chenris surmises that the cult would almost definitely not attack them since the spell they are performing is so complex, it needs their whole focus to maintain it. As they're discussing their options, The ground begins to shake violently as a massive earthquake happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

While Korrigan Misty Steps out of the cage and attempts to pry open the bars. He uses one of his Sprite Totems to give everyone some basic healing and to increase his physical strength enough to bend the bars in a way that lets Mordecai slip through. With Chenris still out of commission, the two-way up their options, they think about just killing her and being done with it, but they're worried that that would kill Chenris first. In the end, they decide to just restrain and blindfold her so they can buy some time and wait for everything to blow over. Eventually, the hour was up, and Chenris woke up feeling quite craggy and weird. Suddenly snapping back into focus, he asks for a complete rundown of what's happened. Once he heard that charms still had a few minutes left, he suggested using that time to learn some more. They ask about the staff to see what abilities it may have, only to learn that it's just decorative and has no abilities. They also learnt that the witch is a warlock of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], explaining that she just likes the abilities she gets from him, she doesn't care much for the God himself. Unsure if this news should reassure them or worry them, they turn around to discuss their next moves.  She is a warlock with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

They walk through the portal and encounter a room filled with clocks, all progressing at different speeds. At the back of the room, near the alter is a large time disturbance with a few crystals floating around it. Korrigan immediately recognises these as the very same ones that are found at the top of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Aidan is too afraid to say anything so Korrigan says hi to the priest - and old, dishevelled man. He greets them and asks if there is anything they would like to talk about. They say they have a few questions about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. They say that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is a bad God and they want to know why he does what he does. The priest laments as he does not have the authority to answer that question. He does say that all of the Gods act on their own interests and what is best for them and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is the same. They ask who's authority he speaks of and just says that he is just a priest and wouldn't dare speak for the deity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Korrigan then asks why the priest would worship a God that is known to sow so much chaos and misery. The priest says that the God is not all bad is actually response for the passage of time and keeping it moving forward at the right pace. Without [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] it is unknown what would happen to time, it could reverse or speed up. Moving on, they point to the crystals and ask what their purpose is. He explains that they were put their by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|the temple]] founders when the room was constructed to allow people to enter without them rapidly aging. The priest doesn't know much about the crystals themselves since they were there when he arrived and no one really knows either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Upon hearing this, the priest perks up and says he knowns all about that incident and therefore knows Aidan very well and applauds him for a job well done. Pissed off, Korrigan asks what he means by that. The priest elaborates and says that Aidan did what his god wanted him to do, which is something to congratulate him on. Korrigan turns on his heels and grabs Aidan to leave, as they are Aidan shouts "WHAT AM I?!". The priest isn't sure but if had to guess he would say "You're [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]' - you belong to him". Aidan starts to cry at this revelation and the priest says "i'd be careful around [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]] if i were you". This stops Korrigan in his tracks and asks him what does he mean. The priest elaborates that "Well, you caused one tower to fall, i'm sure he would like to see another fall". korri exclaims "SO WOULD [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|LORWYN]]" and leaves just before the priest calls [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] a feckless bastard. Being dragged out, Aidan's last view of the priest is distorted and his face is replaced by a big black smile of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | They return to the main library area where Korrigan says that Aidan needs to learn how to use his magic. He explains that it often activates when you really need to use the magic and while the magic does come from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], it is Aidan's will to do what he wants with the energy. This helps him calm down until he hears in his ear "or my will" from [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Some time later, Chenris and Mordecai return from [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|Aeloria's room]] looking incredibly troubled, especially Mordecai. Chenris still looks incredibly angry, still in his summer form. Korrigan tries to ask what happened and all Mordecai can muster is a meek sorry. He goes on to explain that he was offered a deal and now looking back he really regrets not taking it. If he had, then everyone would know all about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and so much more but it came a step cost of himself. Taking the deal would lead to him forgetting everything about himself and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|his mother]] all of him would be gone and would start from scratch. upon hearing this Korrigan is on verge of tears and gives him the biggest hug and explains that he received a similar deal but he at least got to keep most of his memories. Mordecai start to weep and Korrigan comforts him by saying it ok, if you think about it we didn't even know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] existed a few weeks ago and they learnt so much since then, we can always learn about the dragon the old fashioned way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Mordecai is very smug going into this room as he is aware, to an extent, of Chenris' soul. They enter the portal and are greeted with a room where books are floating everywhere. At the altar is a shimmering orb, very similar to the one in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s library. Mordecai walks up very cock and says hi, they reply in Mordecai's head. Mordecai has a few questions and wants chenris to know the answers. The orb agrees to broadcast their voice to both of them. He asks about chenris soul and the orb snarky remarks "Why does chenris want his soul back"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Korrigan thinks that the other must also be low on magic and decides to go find them to give them all potions. At that moment, Not-Mord, Not- Chenris, Not-Aidan and Not-Drache walk in and see hi. They raise alarm bells for korr when Not-Chenris says Korrigan is so much better than them at most things. he believes him (Due to a low roll). They talk for a bit and Not-Aidan slips up about [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] and makes Korrigan suspicious.

It take a Cyanid pill before the group could get much information out of it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 11\|Session 11]] | Halfway through his investigation the flow of time slows, fearing the influence of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], Chenris readies himself for combat but is instead confronted by, what can only be described as, two demons that appear on the mad mage's shoulders. Chenris questions if they are the reason for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]]'s current condition and they conform his suspicions saying its really funny. Chenris ask why they would do this to such a bright mage. The demons laugh and state they did this because he was poking his nose in a place it shouldn't belong and we needed some entertainment. After getting over the initial shock of such otherworldly creatures, Chenris is able to determine these a creatures as what the academic community call [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]], hailing from The Realm of Magic. A place deeply entangled but distinct from one that all humanoids walk, and the source for all the world's magic. Not much is known about this realm or the creatures before the elf, but one thing if for certain, Chenris was in the presence of some very powerful creatures and one wrong move could spell his end. Putting up his best facade, Chenris laughs and acknowledged that is hilarious to watch such a great mage fall from such heights to the shivering mess of a man before him. The demons give great belly laughs before saying in a much more serious tone "You should also watch what you stick your nose into." before disappearing and allowing for the passage of time to continue as normal. Winterbor excitedly asks if he is ready for a grand tea party. Chenris, holding back his panic, affirms his readiness and tells him he will be picked up when the time is right and makes his exit with Winterbor returning to his antics. |

As they are traveling through the rolling hills of The Dawn, Aidan spots a mysterious black figure off in the distance. Drawn in he recognises the creature's uncanny lack of face and the familiar pain of looking at [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] too long. Aidan, who had been becoming more and more unstable with matters related to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and his [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|black cult]] immediately yelled in fear and looked away and suffered the penalty to his memory and forgot.

With their encounter resolved, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] regrouped, the weight of Chenris’ decision and the looming threat of the gods shaping their next steps as they prepared to delve deeper into their perilous journey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Their quest for the ritual pages took them repeatedly into [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], each time arriving at a clearing with a house in various stages of decay. Each mission brought them closer to the house's original state, revealing more of its history and its occupants’ tragic past. On their second-to-last mission, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] encountered a man building a home alongside his pregnant wife and child. The man recounted a harrowing tale of leaving [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] and making a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] to survive a treacherous sea journey. In exchange for safe passage, the god claimed their second-born child, an act that still haunted the family. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] acquired the page but left in stunned silence, burdened by the cruelty of the god and the suffering he inflicted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
