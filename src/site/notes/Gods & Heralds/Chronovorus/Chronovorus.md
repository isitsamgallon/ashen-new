>"AND FROM THE BREACH IN THE FABRIC OF TIME came the Chronovorus, the Eater of Days, whose form was not fixed, and whose hunger knew no end. He passed unseen through ages, devouring what was and what might be, until even memory turned to dust." <cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Chronovorus is a shifting, formless being born of Broken time, a presence that slips through cracks in Causality and memory. It does not speak, only consumes - Eras, events, and identities vanishing in its wake. To Witness it is to feel moments unravel, as if the world Itself forgets its own story. It does not hunger out of Malice, but simply because it exists where time no Longer holds meaning.

### General Information
**The Temporal Harbinger, Bringer of Chaos.** Although he dedicates most of his time to using his powers to sow chaos across [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] for his own amusement, he is also responsible for maintaining the flow of time and keeping it moving forward at the correct speed. He often makes pacts with mortals, with his most common pact being to take parts of their lifespans in exchange for help with a problem or strength. He often appears in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], choosing to take the form of a cloud of black smoke with nothing but a creepy smile levitating in it, halting time when he does appear. He also causes time rifts to open across the Amber Realm, which bleeds time, causing chaos and agony wherever they appear. 

He has devotees in the form of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]] who perform sacrifices on random people and give their remaining lifespans to the God. He has a few heralds who help to spread his influence, though his main one is [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], who takes children and drains them of their remaining years to give to Chronovorus. He presides over [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], where he spends a lot of his time watching the realms and waiting for the end of time.

### Divine Attributes
- Chronovorus rules over the volatile domains of Time, Chaos, Destruction, Entropy, and Manipulation. He Embodies the inevitable decay of all things and the Unravelling of order, where time fractures and spirals Into uncertainty, and nothing remains fixed for long. 
- His symbols are a shattered hourglass bleeding away Time, a spiral fractal hinting at infinite, chaotic paths, And a clock face stripped of its hands- a chilling Emblem of time unbound. 
- The sacred colours of his worship are black, dark Violet, and shimmering silver: black for the void Between moments, violet for the turbulence of Disorder, and silver for the glint of unrealized Potential.
- Creatures sacred to him include ethereal serpents That slip through time's current, and shadow crows Whose presence heralds disruption, decay, and the Slow collapse of reality.

### Mythos & Legends
Chronovorus, god of Time, Chaos, and Entropy, is a Divine paradox-born not of destruction, but of Compassion. From the heart of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], goddess of Mercy and Fate, he was brought into being during a Moment of cosmic sorrow, forged from her silent grief
At witnessing the unchanging suffering of mortals. In Seeking to ease their burdens, she birthed time itself only To find that its flow could not be contained. Thus, Chronovorus emerged: a god who saw not the mercy in Order, but the freedom in unravelling.

From his first breath, he was captivated by time's wild Beauty, choosing to sever it from predictability and turn It into a force of disruption. To Chronovorus, time is a Canvas best left unfinished, full of potential when Unbound. He exists to twist, to tangle, and to remind
Creation that nothing is eternal-not even the gods.

One legend recounts how he fractured the timeline of a Once-great empire. With a thought, he opened temporal Rifts across their lands-aging cities into dust while Others regressed to their dawn. The empire collapsed in Confusion, its people splintered into rival ages, unable to Recognize kin or cause. Today, their broken remnants Still shimmer across time, caught in cycles they cannot Escape.

A tale told with both awe and warning is that of the Emerald Swan, an artifact created by a mortal sorcerer Who begged Chronovorus for eternal life. Amused, the God granted his wish-but bound the man's lifespan to Those around him. Though long-lived, each bearer
Suffered cruel and ironic ends, their longevity a hollow Curse. In this, Chronovorus revealed his truth: time is a Gift best left unasked for.

His relationship with his sister, [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], goddess of Light and Knowledge, is one of eternal opposition. Where she seeks to preserve and illuminate, he seeks to Obscure and undo. Their divine conflict is written into The bones of the world- into the rise and fall of empires,
The flicker of stars, and the split-second choices that Shape mortal fate.

Yet Chronovorus is not evil- only inevitable. He is the Reminder that all things change, that endings come, and That from every unravelling, something strange and new Might emerge. Born of mercy, he became chaos Incarnate- and in his wake, the world continues to turn.

| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | The forest fire slowed unnaturally, frozen in time as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] watched in awe and confusion. When Kalโs attempts to interact with the suspended flames failed, shattering his dagger upon contact, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] โs alarm grew. A mysterious figure emerged from the haze, manipulating the stillness around them with intricate gestures. Introducing himself as Aiden, he revealed his ability to close temporal distortions, which were caused by the chaos-bringing deity [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Though he provided little detail, Aiden joined [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] on their journey to Two Pines Estate, his enigmatic presence adding to the tension of their travels.                                                                                                                                |

They split up, with Chenris, Mordecai, and Aiden seeking answers in the towerโs grand library while Kal and Drache delivered a mysterious package from Foxtail Orchard. Chenris uncovered information about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]], a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] with the power to manipulate time and erase memories. Meanwhile, Kal fell victim to a goblin trap and was turned into a magically compelled suicide bomber. With no way to stop Kalโs march toward [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the Black Tower]], [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] himself appeared, offering to resolve the crisis for 25 years of their lives.                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Chenris rejected the offer and disappeared, finding himself in the presence of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], the Goddess of Light and Knowledge. She offered him the means to dispel the ancient goblin magic in exchange for a portion of his magical abilities. Accepting the deal, Chenris returned to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], dispelling the magic and saving Kal. [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], amused and intrigued by the group, warned them that the cost of retrieving the missing child would rise with each passing day. With their encounter resolved, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] regrouped, the weight of Chenrisโ decision and the looming threat of the gods shaping their next steps as they prepared to delve deeper into their perilous journey.                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Their quest for the ritual pages took them repeatedly into [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]], each time arriving at a clearing with a house in various stages of decay. Each mission brought them closer to the house's original state, revealing more of its history and its occupantsโ tragic past. On their second-to-last mission, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] encountered a man building a home alongside his pregnant wife and child. The man recounted a harrowing tale of leaving [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] and making a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] to survive a treacherous sea journey. In exchange for safe passage, the god claimed their second-born child, an act that still haunted the family. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] acquired the page but left in stunned silence, burdened by the cruelty of the god and the suffering he inflicted. |
