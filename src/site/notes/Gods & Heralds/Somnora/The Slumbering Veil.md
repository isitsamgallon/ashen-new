> "AND THEY SHALL DRIFT INTO THE VEIL, WHERE time forgets to count and silence hums with song. There, beneath quilted skies and star-born dreams, the soul shall wander through joy and terror alike, cradled ever in the arms of sleep."<cite> Book of Velvet Shadows, Dreamline 8:3 </cite>


### Overview
The divine realm of [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], goddess of Dreams, Sleep, Secrets, Illusion, and the Unconscious, is known as the Slumbering Veil-a place of perpetual twilight where stars drift lazily through a velvet sky and a moon of shifting size watches over the land in silence. The entire plane is impossibly soft, formed of endless hills  and valleys made from pillows, blankets, and woven sheets of mist. The ground gives underfoot with a gentle
sigh, and the air is warm and hushed, like the final exhale before sleep.

Here, all is stillness and rest-but not all is peace.

At the realm's heart lie two grand temples, equal in power yet opposite in nature. The first is the Temple of Dreams, a radiant palace of floating silks, glowing lanterns, and drifting lullabies. It is a sanctuary of light and joy, where the best memories of visitors are played
back in brilliant, surreal tableaux. Wishes whispered in sleep echo through its halls, sometimes answered in cryptic gifts or fleeting visions. Laughter, music, and the scent of childhood nostalgia fill the air. It is a place of wonder, where even gods might pause to dream.

But across a vast valley of shifting fog and shadow looms the Temple of Nightmares-a black-stoned fortress half-sunken into the soft terrain. Screams echo faintly from within, muffled as if heard through thick bedding. This temple houses the horrors buried deep in
the unconscious mind: twisted demons, malformed fears, and impossible landscapes that claw at reason. It is said those who enter face their darkest truths, and some do not return unchanged-though [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] allows none to be truly lost within.

Between the two temples, dreams and nightmares churn together in an endless tide. Sleepers from across the realms sometimes find themselves here unknowingly, walking through memories, illusions, or fears plucked from their own minds. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] herself
rarely appears, but when she does, it is in many forms sometimes a child in a blanket fort, sometimes a faceless shadow beneath a canopy of stars.

In the Slumbering Veil, time stretches and folds. A night may feel like a century, or pass in an instant. Nothing is stable, yet nothing is threatening-unless it needs to be. The realm comforts and confronts in equal measure, shaping itself to the heart of each visitor.

To rest here is to be seen. To dream here is to be known. And to wake is never quite to leave.
