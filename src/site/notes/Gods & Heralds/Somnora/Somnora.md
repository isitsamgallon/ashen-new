> "AND IN THE HUSH OF THE NINTH HOUR CAME Somnora, the Veil of Night, whose mantle is woven of stars and whose breath brings sleep to kings and beggars alike. She walks the hidden paths between waking and wonder, and in her shadow bloom the dreams of men. Her voice is the hush before the storm, the lullaby of eternity, and she binds the restless with visions both divine and dreadful. For in her dominion, the soul is laid bare, and truth is whispered in riddles."<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Somnora drifts through the folds of night, her form shrouded in shadow and starlight. She speaks in dreams, in symbols, in the quiet just before sleep takes hold. Neither kind nor cruel, she shows mortals what they most need to see - or what they fear they already
know. She is the boundary between rest and revelation, a guide through the strange landscapes of the soul.

### General Information
The daughter of [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]], who was created to oversee the realm of dreams. Originally, [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] attempted to manage both the waking and dreaming worlds, but the unpredictable nature of dreams made it difficult for him to maintain balance. Realising that he could not effectively govern both realms, he birthed Somnora to take charge of the sleeping world while he focused on the waking one.

Though little else is known about her, Somnora exists to ensure that the dream world remains stable, separate from the structured reality that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] maintains. Her creation signifies a division of responsibilities among the gods, ensuring that both realms—waking and dreaming—are properly maintained.

### Divine Attributes
- Somnora is the goddess of Dreams, Sleep, Secrets, Illusion, and the Unconscious- a quiet guide through the twilight realms where reality softens and hidden truths stir. She moves unseen through slumbering minds, weaving visions, omens, and forgotten memories.
- Her symbols echo her dreamlike nature: a closed eye surrounded by stars, a crescent moon cradled in an open palm, and a misted veil over still water- each marking the boundary between waking and dream. 
- The sacred colors of her worship are midnight blue, soft lavender, and silver- blue for sleep's depths, lavender for the haze of dreams, and silver for hidden insight.
- Creatures sacred to Somnora include dusk moths that carry fragments of dreams, star-furred dream hounds that guard the sleeping mind, and glass-eyed owls that see into the soul's quiet depths.

### Mythos & Legends
Somnora, goddess of Dreams, Sleep, Secrets, Illusion, and the Unconscious, walks the unseen paths between waking and oblivion. Born from the will of [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] to tend what lies beyond mortal awareness, she was shaped from silence, starlight, and the breath between
thoughts. While her father maintains balance in the waking world, Somnora guards the realm of slumberwhere memories drift, truths hide, and the soul wanders free.

She did not come into the world with sound or fury, but with a sigh that blanketed the world in its first true sleep. From that stillness, her domain blossomed: a boundless dreamscape where time flows strangely and thoughts take form. Somnora weaves illusions and visions through the minds of mortals, offering comfort, insight, or sometimes, subtle warnings.

One of the oldest myths tells of the Night of the Silver  Silence, when a mad wizard, obsessed with uncovering forbidden knowledge, breached the veil between waking
and dreaming. Twisting his own soul into a vessel of nightmare, he sought to corrupt the dreams of all who slept, reshaping the world through their minds. Somnora met him not with wrath, but with quiet resolve. Cloaked in moonlight, she sealed him within the deepest recess of the dreamscape, banishing his corruption. It is said she left part of herself behind in the prison, a fragment of her essence watching eternally to ensure he never stirs again. 

Somnora is also the keeper of hidden truths. Her dreams come as riddles- visions filled with meaning only the wise or willing can decipher. Seers and oracles seek her whispers, yet she never speaks plainly. She offers glimpses, symbols, and shifting stars- truths that
must be chased through shadows.

Rarely worshipped in grand temples, Somnora is instead honored in intimate rituals: a token placed beneath a pillow, a lullaby sung to a restless child, a whispered plea to guard the soul through the dark. Her gifts are subtle- an untroubled sleep, a forgotten memory returned, or a dream that changes the course of a life.

To know Somnora is to walk the threshold between what is and what might be. She is the stillness before waking, the echo behind the dream, and the soft, unseen  hand that shields the mind when all else fades.

### Worship & Rituals 
#### The Night OF Veils
Held on the longest night of the year, this silent festival honours Somnora through masked processions and lantern-lit walks. Offerings of sleep-poppies and whispered secrets are left at her shrines, and dreams had on this night are believed to carry hidden truths.

#### The Mirror Dreaming
Priests guide dreamers through this ritual by placing a silver mirror and bowl of water beside them as they sleep. Anointed with lavender oil, the dreamer is believed to receive Somnora's guidance, sometimes reflected faintly in the mirror by morning.

#### The Whispering Hour
At midnight, followers whisper thoughts, questions, or fears into the quiet before sleep. It is believed Somnora hears these and answers through dreams, her messages wrapped in symbols and subtle visions. 

### Artifacts & Relics
#### Viel Of The Unseen Moon
A gossamer shawl woven from dream-thread andstarlight. When worn during sleep or trance, it allows entry into others' dreams or grants visions. Overuse may blur the line between dreaming and reality.

#### Obsidian Eye
A smooth black stone set in a circlet or amulet. It grants lucid dreams and shields against nightmares, but may reveal hidden truths the bearer isn't ready to face.

#### Hourglass Of forgotten Whispers
An hourglass filled with silver dust. When flipped, it erases one memory from anyone nearby for a day. Meant to ease pain or hide secrets- but dangerous if misused.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awoke on a bed. Their entire body was lying on cushions made of duck feathers and silk. Aware they were most likely in [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]]'s domain, they slowly opened their eyes and looked around without drawing too much attention. When they knew the coast was clear, they slowly got up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | The person at the table awoke suddenly, revealing themselves to a lady with deep and dark eye bags. Her voice seemed to reverberate through the air with authority even amongst the frequent yawns. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they had just woken up, to which [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] replied, "I'm constantly awake and asleep. I am all that happens between the living hours."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] remarked that they understand; most of the time, they struggle to wake up in the morning, especially when it's very early. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] smirked, noting they seemed more drawn to this place than most. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] commented that many gods seemed to reach out to them and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]], and assuming the person informed of them was really [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|somnora]], that would be another checked off the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] nodded, saying, "At the end of every day, you know...That I am here. However hard your day, however long, however painful, you know that I'm always here. I will always be here for your species, for your people, for... your planets. I will always provide a safe space. What would you say I am?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], slightly taken aback, quickly changed the subject, mentioning how many of their friends seemed to be worried for [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Gesturing to heaven, the world went quiet. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had begun to hear their [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|companions]] shouting their name repeatedly. Sad they had to leave so quickly after arriving, they started making an awkward farewell. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] passively said, "It's ok, maybe next time you'll remember"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | Confused, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked what they were talking about. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] explained, "We've met before, we'll meet again. Please tell your Party to thank me. For warning them"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | There was a moment of confusion before [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] linked what [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] was talking about [^3], immediately stepping back and thanking them for their help. And asked if there was any way [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] could properly thank her for her help. [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] simply requested that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] leave some Lavender at their altar when possible. Plants don't really grow where they live, and they love flowers. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] nodded and returned to the waking world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | After [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] recovered from the pain, they explained, very matter-of-factly, that they had met [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], meeting [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]]'s surprise by queering if this really was a weird experience for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Fatebreakers]], to which they all had to admit that it unfortunately wasn't. When asked what they talked about, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained how [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] felt that [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] was indebted ot them and how they had helped [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] with prophetic dreams a week ago and hadn't had a single thanks for it. Upon [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] hearing that the goddess wanted lavender, he snuck away to find some [^4].                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | With that out of the way, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] continued on and found a multifaith church. The building was old and rotting, and the inside wasn't much better, as it was completely empty and dilapidated. On the far end were 4 altars. One was dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], one to [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and the last to [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]. They approached the altar and laid the lavender on it. They all turned to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and asked him to pray. After doing so, the lavender vanished, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] felt a rush of strange energy wash over them. As [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the one to pray, he immediately knew that this was a boon from [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] and would allow them to sleep anywhere and not fear the consequences. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] quickly got up and began to leave. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] stopped and said they had an idea. They began to write down the events of what they saw in [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]]'s celestial plane. They then put that on [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s altar and prayed. This led to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] receiving a new boon that told them about all the interesting things in the area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]] | The priest went on to explain that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] used to look after the dreaming world as well, but he struggled to keep track because the rules were different. He still had to maintain balance over the waking parts of the universe. After a few instances of things going wrong, the god decided it would be best to create someone who would watch over the sleeping world while he focused on the waking world. This caused him to give birth to his daughter, whom he named [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
