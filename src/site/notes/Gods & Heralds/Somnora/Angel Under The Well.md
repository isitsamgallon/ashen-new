| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]]              | A while later, as they approached [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Oceanvale\|Oceanvale]], [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] suddenly remembered a quest request they had there. Upon rereading the quest details, the situation sounded very similar to the '[[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]]' they had encountered in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Newhall\|Newhall]]. If that were the case, it would be wise to rest outside the city to avoid being enchanted by the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] in their sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]]              | Once everyone was ready, they slowly walked down the tunnels, guided by [[The Party/Halfbie\|halfbie]]'s senses. They soon approached a large cave opening. And in the middle, surrounded by corpses, sense and blood, was the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]]              | They charge one enough, and after a long and difficult fight, The "Fatebreakers finally defeat "the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]]. As "its body began to fade away, it snarled its final words, "You will never truly kill me, I will be back, and you will die a painful death."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 07\|Session 07]] | It was terrifyingly fast and strong, moving through the battle field with relative easy and it landed heavy blows of magic and steel. The party fought valiantly, almost defeating the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]] of an unknown god to them. They however did not survive, with Aidan being the last one standing due to rogues being known for their ability to evade damage. Once all of the party went down a voice echoed in their and the herald's head that said "No this is not where their story ends" and healed them the party and the herald back to full health. The herald spoke to the party in the common tongue, disgusted at having to use such a vile language and said that they best leave not interfere with its plans or suffer the consequences |
