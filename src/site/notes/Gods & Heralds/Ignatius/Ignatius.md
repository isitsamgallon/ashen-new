### Mythos & Legends
Ignatius, god of Fire, Wrath, and Rebirth, is worshipped And feared as the embodiment of divine flame-at once Destroyer and purifier. Where others see fire as chaos ,Ignatius sees sacred purpose: to burn away the rot of The old so that something greater may rise from the Ashes. His arrival in the mortal realm is not considered A descent, but an eruption-an inevitable blaze foretold In smoke and scripture.

The Prophecy of [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|the Cleansing]] Flame, whispered Through generations by [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]], foretold his Coming. It spoke of a god who would descend not in Mercy, but in judgment, wielding fire to purge Corruption and sin. The prophecy came to pass with the Shattering of the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], a divine barrier once Shielding the mortal realm from direct godly Intervention. When it broke, the world trembled, and Ignatius walked through.

This marked the beginning of [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]], a Cataclysm that scorched [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|the Amber Realms]]. With Legions of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] and fire-wreathed zealots at his Side, Ignatius razed entire kingdoms in his wake, Leaving behind only smouldering ruins. [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The coalition]] of Mortal defenders-heroes, mages, and god-touched Champions-fought back against the inferno, Culminating in the Siege of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. There, they Succeeded in halting his advance, but not in ending him.

As his physical form crumbled, Ignatius declared his Divine truth: that fire cannot die. He vowed to return, not In vengeance, but to finish what was begun. His Followers, [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]], still carry this flame spreading His doctrine, branding his mark into the World, and waiting for the hour when the embers Reignite and the purification begins anew.

To revere Ignatius is to accept that pain births strength, And that destruction may be a mercy. In every wildfire, Every volcano's roar, his voice can still be heard reminding The world that its end may yet be its Beginning.
