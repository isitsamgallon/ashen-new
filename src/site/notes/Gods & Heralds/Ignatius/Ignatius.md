Upon the earth he Brought judgment, his footsteps thunder, his fury Sanctified by fire, that the impure might be purged."<cite> [[Named Characters & Beasts/Nehzahr\|Nehzahr]] </cite>

This included making the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]], which could reduce anyone it slashed to ash and reform them as part of the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army. 

It is said in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] that [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], are large volcano found in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] was "as a conduit to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]].

### Mythos & Legends
Ignatius, god of Fire, Wrath, and Rebirth, is worshipped And feared as the embodiment of divine flame-at once Destroyer and purifier. Where others see fire as chaos ,Ignatius sees sacred purpose: to burn away the rot of The old so that something greater may rise from the Ashes. His arrival in the mortal realm is not considered A descent, but an eruption-an inevitable blaze foretold In smoke and scripture.

The Prophecy of [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|the Cleansing]] Flame, whispered Through generations by [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]], foretold his Coming. It spoke of a god who would descend not in Mercy, but in judgment, wielding fire to purge Corruption and sin. The prophecy came to pass with the Shattering of the [[Other Information/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], a divine barrier once Shielding the mortal realm from direct godly Intervention. When it broke, the world trembled, and Ignatius walked through.

This marked the beginning of [[History & Events/The Sundering\|the Sundering]], a Cataclysm that scorched [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|the Amber Realms]]. With Legions of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] and fire-wreathed zealots at his Side, Ignatius razed entire kingdoms in his wake, Leaving behind only smouldering ruins. [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The coalition]] of Mortal defenders-heroes, mages, and god-touched Champions-fought back against the inferno, Culminating in the Siege of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]. There, they Succeeded in halting his advance, but not in ending him.

As his physical form crumbled, Ignatius declared his Divine truth: that fire cannot die. He vowed to return, not In vengeance, but to finish what was begun. His Followers, [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|the Ashen Cult]], still carry this flame spreading His doctrine, branding his mark into the World, and waiting for the hour when the embers Reignite and the purification begins anew.

To revere Ignatius is to accept that pain births strength, And that destruction may be a mercy. In every wildfire, Every volcano's roar, his voice can still be heard reminding The world that its end may yet be its Beginning.

### Worship & Rituals

#### The Ember Vigil
Held annually at [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], this gathering of Followers includes sermons by the cult's leaders and Ceremonies invoking Ignatius's name. It is a night of Fiery displays, prayers, and oaths of loyalty to [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|the Cleansing]] Flame.

### Artifacts & Relics

### What Faith Means to the Moderates
The moderates of the faction believe Ignatius will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Ignatius's Room\|The priest]] gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|humans]], the [[Other Information/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|humans]], led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]], there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the [[Locations/OFC/OFC\|OFC]] is a pillar of freedom and equality.

### What Faith Means to the Extremists 
The extremists believe that Ignatius will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction.

| [[Session Notes/Season 5 - Freedom's Flame/Session 43\|Session 43]]               | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] suggested they all try tailing someone who was a part of the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] mafia to see if he would lead them to the pub. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] asked if that would be wise, as it would be very obvious if a group of 5 were following one [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] of [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suggested they take turns tailing the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] while the rest stayed back, and they could then swap out at various points to keep suspicions low. They agreed this was the best plan and soon found a [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] that fit the typical archetype for the mafia and began tailing them. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was the first to tail them and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to the church of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] finally spotted him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] who walked around [[Locations/Lost Haven/Siltwater Slums\|Siltwater Slums]] for a while, almost as if they were patrolling. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was soon caught, and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took over and followed the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] to a wooden gate, where the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] paid two platinum coins to the guard, who let him through. As the [[Other Information/Races/Goblin\|goblin]] walked through, he spotted [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but did nothing about them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

They thanked him, saying it was lovely. Now that they were closer, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began looking for any branding on the man that would have come from [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius#The Scorched Pledge\|The Scorched Pledge]] as a way to check if this priest was the real deal. Unfortunately, there weren't many marks apart from his slave number being scorched into his chest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] says that he doesn't really care as long as it is painless and soon, so he won't have to deal with the fiery explosions that come with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' return.

When his soldiers and followers die, their souls get sent to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s eternal battlefield, where they fight a myriad of monsters, demons and beasts. Moderates who had given up on war go to the same place but are put in a separate area, which is covered in fire, and people are in great pain. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is the general of his army and is too busy to come to see the moderates, so it is believed that even though the existence will be painful, it will be peaceful.

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explains that this room is rarely used and is not known to many people. Additionally, many of the staff do not enter the different rooms dedicated to the Gods; they would not know he was dead for many weeks or even months. After [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked, he confirmed that the number of people, excluding [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], who knew of this room could be counted on one hand. Without a moment's hesitation, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] drew his bow and shot [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] in the head. The arrow buried deep in the priest's eye, threatening to come out the other side. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] crumpled to the floor, dead instantly. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained to the shocked members of his party that killing him now would ensure that no one related to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] would ever be able to find out about The Tower and would serve to buy them time. They admitted he had a point, but [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] and Aidan were annoyed that none were given a say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

With such fiery motifs, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] couldn’t help but draw comparisons with the group and the cult of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] and asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer]] Willow if she knew anything about this brotherhood through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]. However, she was less than helpful - claiming that she had never heard of them before. Unconvinced, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] kept pressing her for information, asking her very bluntly how she died. This provoked outrage from the dead woman in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s head, demanding that [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] should kill him on the spot for such insensitivity and rudeness. Naturally, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] refused, a little tired of the constant desperation of the woman’s violence towards his party members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | Outside, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] took a deep breath as they mentally prepared to enter [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' room. Questioning out loud if this was really the correct thing to do. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] suggested that I couldn't hurt to ask, worst case, they could all step in to help if it came to that. Slightly reassured, they all entered the room. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] was sitting near the altar reading as they all entered. He greeted them warmly, asking if there was anything he could do to help. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] dodged around the subject as they asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] knew of someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he knew of her when they both fought in the war and explained that she was a great general who gave her life to destroy an entire army Battalion. He explained that in some circles, she is regarded as almost a sudo [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks why [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] isn't smart or doesn't have a hoard if they're [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. Korrigan reasons this is because he is only half dragon, and those traits must've been lost a while ago. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] was about to take offence to this before realising that it was probably true. While this conversation continues, the voice in Mordecai's head says they could quickly get rid of the dragon and this stupid [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. Grabbing their head, Mordecai shouts out loud for the voice to get out of their head. The voice says they'll be quiet for now. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] offers to cast [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-identify?srsltid=**AfmBOormiFf2_jmssP0NB69iN4CbEb2K8ouci6XZ_DqIs6ZEnNoamb8F**) on the crown so they can figure out what is going on. Mordecai reveals he knows exactly what is happening, and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no chance of knowing since their memory is terrible. The Eldarin looks quite hurt by this but doesn't say anything. Mordecai explains what they saw when they touched the crown and that they were very reminiscent of the vision and ideals belonging to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. They explain that while they don't agree with everything God says, some of it hits a cord with them, and they have been thinking about it for a while now. This crown might be an artefact of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]].                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] steps back and nervously says they absolutely cannot be here and should bury the crown and leave as soon as possible. Korrigan stands in front of Mordecai and asks them what about the teachings of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] they like and points out how these 'cleansing flames' killed their [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|mother]] and burned their house to the ground. Before they can finish the sentence, Mordecai slaps him. Korrigan sees the slap coming and lets it land, never breaking eye contact with the Teifling. Suddenly the damn broke, and korrigan started shouting that Mordecai had watched them all slowly become puppets of the gods and was meant to remain free of all that. Mordecai fires back, saying everyone, even the gods, has abandoned them. This power would allow them to clean the slate and start fresh finally. Korrigan's eyes narrowed as he said, "Do you know why the smartest people end up working for the worst people? It's because they are better at rationalising the wrong things they do". Korrigan lets Mordecai through to get to the crown before saying that Mordecai was the one who taught him that. Mordecai begins to say something before the voice in their head speaks again, saying that their power can make everything ok again. Mordecai grabs their head again, shouting and screaming for the voice to get out of their head. They begin to break down as they exclaim how alone they are and want to be loved. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] opens the door a little further and finds that the red cloaks don't have bodies; they are just large motes of flames. Many more floating flames were hovering around the room, keeping it bright. The Firesoul Greatsword was floating a few feet off the ground in the middle. Mordecai is highly tempted to grab the blade as the voice tells them to claim their prize. Mordecai resists the urea but becomes irritated when the voice mocks him for not figuring out who they're being possessed by. Korrigan says "Hi Ebis" on a whim to the voice. The voice laughs as it exclaims that she is way better than that pretender. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks if the voice is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]]; she says she is much better than that fool, saying, "They are nought but a twinkle in my eye". The voice begins to tease them that being in Mordecai's mind is very fun as they get to know so much about his past, including that letter to their father and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Claribelle Reverence †\|Claribelle's death]]. Mordecai tells the voice to get out of their head that they don't need an army and they don't need any help. The voice laughs manically as they explain that all of their efforts are pitiful compared to the power of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. Mordecai was also told not to worry about it, as although they can't control Mordecai's body yet, soon they will, and it won't matter.                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | Korrigan whispers to Drache and asks if they can quickly cast [Detect Good and Evil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good) and see what they learn. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] does just then and, to his horror, detects a considerable amount of undead energy emanating from Mordecai. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] hurriedly explains what he feels to Korrigan, who claims he'll cast his protection spell on Mordecai so they can ensure that Mordecai does not lose control over his body. The voice retorts that if they do that, they will make sure that when she leaves, she will make sure there will be nothing left of Mordecai's brain to function. Suddenly, it clicks with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] doesn't have any family, but they did recall that in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]], there was a female war general called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]. Willow confirms that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is correct and says that if they've read their bible, they know what can happen when too much of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' power is channelled through someone, and she can do that if anyone makes any wrong moves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | The temple is huge and made of white marble with magical crystals and bubbles floating around the large building. There is a small town located around the temple. Inside there are people in similar white robes likes in [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Before going in, Chenris pulls Mordecai aside and tells him not to mention their involvement with the gods this time, since he would like to look around. Mordecai sheepishly agrees to stay quiet. Chenris talks to the receptionist and pretends not to know who the all-father is. The receptionist is very accommodating and would love to answer questions about the gods. In this temple, they worship all of the Gods, especially [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Curious, Korrigan asks about their opinions on the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s. They say they like the heralds of gods who are seen as peace-loving and kind like [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] however, the heralds associated with gods like [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] often come to death's destruction so they would be hesitant to invite this in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | The priest notes he must have a grudge and he will see what he can do and they say farewell. Korrigan exists in his room just as the others are leaving their room and Korrigan is left stunned and confused as to why people would want to talk to the followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. They catch each other up on what they see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This room is full of fire brazers, torches and other flame iconography. They find the priest waiting for them and gives them a warm greeting. Mordecai asks if he sees many visitors. He explains that he doesn't get a lot from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] but he does get a handful from [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]], the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]], the islands to the northeast and lot from [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Chenris enquires about his opinions on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. The priest explains he was not a fan of the huge lose of life that the event caused. The priest elaborates, saying every God has their fanatics and extremists. Even the worshipers of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] have been known to use her name in vain and commit atrocities. Fortunately. There are moderates for every faith, including [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. For example, the extremists believe that [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to come take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction. The moderates of the faction believe [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. The priest gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the humans, the Dwarves were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The humans, led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the OFC, there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the OFC is a pillar of freedom and equality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Chenris then ask what would the followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] do in a theoretically perfect society, surely there would be no need to worship their beloved god since there is no evil to be wiped away. This question stumps the priest as he had never thought of that before, he doesn't have an answer. Chenris is about to leave when stops to ask one final question, "Do you know anything about one master Ebis?" the priest had heard the name but only as someone leading a magic guild somewhere. Mordecai asks if he knows anything about the grand plan. The priest hesitates before explaining, that the grand plan is often about how [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] wants to start [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Second Sundering]]. At this point the priest wants to confess that he was a general in the original army and led a legion of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]], however, he feels immense guilt for his actions and is trying to reform, his name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]].

Aidan asks [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] about deals with Gods. She Confesses that she isn't very familiar with them, she just knows they're not a good idea. Aidan says its a bit too late for that and asks if Gods have been known to grant people power in return for deals. She sighs and explains that the Gods have been known to do this and explains that there was legend of even [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] giving special powers to some kind of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|high priest]] back during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. Aidan reveals he made a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus]] advises that too much of a Gods influence can be "ill advised".
