> "SPEAK NOT THE NAME OF THE WOODS WHERE time forgets its path, for within those twisted boughs the past hunts the present and the future weeps. There, the roots drink from broken timelines, and the trees remember things that never were."<cite> Whispers from the Rift, Fragment III </cite>

### Overview
The divine realm of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] is known as The Crucible Eternal-a realm of unending flame, molten stone, and skies ablaze with divine fire. It is a place of both agony and glory, where ash falls like snow and the air hums with the roar of battle and the crackle of infernos. Rivers of lava carve through jagged mountains, and great obsidian halls rise from scorched plains, housing warriors who have earned their place in [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s eternal forge.

For those who lived by the sword, death in battle is a gateway to glory. These chosen warriors are welcomed as champions, rising each day to fight, bleed, and burn in endless combat beneath [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s gaze. Their wounds heal with each dawn, their spirits fed by the fire of purpose, as they train and war for the day their god shall rise again. To them, the Crucible is not a punishment, but a proving ground- a sacred forge where the weak are remade into something indestructible.

But not all who arrive here are warriors. Those who lived without strength or conviction, or who failed to endure life's trials, find themselves cast into the rivers and pits of flame. They do not die-they endure. Their pain is constant, yet within it lies a strange, searing joy: the feeling of being remade, tested, tempered by divine fire. In time, even the most broken soul may come to laugh through the flame, understanding that suffering here is transformation, not torment.

The realm itself lives and breathes-volcanoes erupt in rhythm, the sky bleeds fire at dusk, and storms of ash twist into divine shapes. [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] rules from the Throne of Embers, seated within the heart of a living volcano, where he watches the battles below and speaks to his chosen through flame and fury. His voice is thunder; his gaze, an inferno.

To outsiders, the Crucible Eternal may seem a place of cruelty. But to those who understand [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], it is sacred- fire as trial, battle as worship, pain as the pathway to glory. Here, the worthy are forged, and the unworthy burned until they become something more.
