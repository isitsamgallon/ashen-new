### Overview
The name given to the being at the centre of the world. See [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] for more information. When he speaks to the party, he speaks in a very archaic and poetic way.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Once out of earshot but still being watched from afar, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exhaled, pleased that they had learned so many interesting things. They were particularly intrigued by the fact that Niaross significantly influenced the wall and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]], which could mean [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]] had something to do with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tried to sense Terathera's presence from the wall but couldn't detect anything. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], looking closer at the wall and then The [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]], tried to understand if anything was happening. As far as they could tell, the stone had been taken from the mountain range, but it was nothing more than regular rock. After a long pause, they assessed that it was probably sedimentary rock, but no geologists were around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ignored her alarming comments and instead focused on telling her all about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and how they were sealed away and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] were hurting them. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that one of his goals in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was to destroy the tower. Sylvia initially didn't believe him until he showed her the book he stole from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], which explained everything to her. After reading the book, she was immediately on board and wanted to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ends the connection between him and [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and returns to the cavern. In a slight daze, they return to face [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], who stands to the side with his head bowed respectfully. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] awkwardly asks if this is when [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] wants to do it, and if so, does he have a way he wants to go? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] says that he doesn't really care as long as it is painless and soon, so he won't have to deal with the fiery explosions that come with [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' return. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] is confused, wondering why he would want to die now as surely he would be sent straight to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]], who was bound to be furious with the priest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 30\|Session 30]]              | The meeting commenced after an awkward pause, when [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] excitedly inquired whether it was possible to incorporate other meats, such as pork or beef, into chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] kindly explained that culinary creativity has no bounds. At this moment, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]  , upon examining a map of [[Other Information/Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]], recalled previous visits to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], where they first learned about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. The group hoped that returning to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] could yield further insights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 29\|Session 29]]              | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that they shouldn't be down here, but he assumed they needed access to one of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] and a room where no one could hear them. He paused for a moment before continuing. He explained that they needed to kill him because it was the only way for them to justify their being down here after they were finished, and he didn't want to be around for what was to come.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | Korrigan turns to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] and tells them to stay put before confronting the dragon. Mordecai and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] ignore him and run out to join him. Mordecai exclaims that they both did stupid things in the past to face this together. The dragon lands in front of them and commands them to explain why they would want to travel to such a remote island. Mordecai replies in Draconic, saying that they wanted to come and speak to it. Korrigan explains that they know [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and know that [[Uti †\|Uti †]] was the last person to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] stares at them before narrowing their eyes at Mordecai. "You touched the crown, didn't you?" it said question. Mordecai apologises for doing so, as they had no idea. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that they can not let anyone leave the island because of that. Shocked, Mordecai tries to sacrifice himself to allow the others to leave. The rest refuse to let this happen, with Korrigan exclaiming that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] will kill one; they must destroy all of them as if they were a meal deal. Before anything else can happen, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] appears from a portal and uses some strange magic to freeze everyone but Mordecai on the spot with a large sigh. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that everyone here has to die, as coming onto this island is enough of a threat to the world. Mordecai claims they have enough audacity that they can't get through this, and nothing terrible will happen and swears on everyone's life. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] exclaims that swearing on these lives means everyone must fight them to the death, and either way - the Gods do not work like that. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] unfreezes everyone before going back through the portal.                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | Korrigan exclaims that if they die anyway, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] may as well answer some of their burning questions. The dragon allows this to happen and asks what their first question is. He asks if they still must be killed if they decide to stay on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] says no. They had signed a contract that said no one could enter or leave the island, or they would die. Korrigan then asks why about [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]] and what they're doing on the island. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their primary purpose is to defend the sword, which has a terrifying power. This leads [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] to make the connection between the sword and [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. They next talk about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that their name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]] and that they had to sell their dear friend with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] to make sure that the Gods were stopped. They also confirm that [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] is slowly dying. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks how they know [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals it's through [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] and that they have been working together for quite a while. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] are related. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has no idea who Ebis is but knows Akin from working together for a long time. Mordecai asks that if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] knew they were going to be killed, then why didn't he warn them of coming here? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] reveals that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has been incredibly busy of late and wasn't aware that they were on their way - [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] refuses to elaborate on what he has been doing. Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] has killed Master Enel Cubus; the dragon confirms that Cubus is dead. With this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] grows tired of asking questions and tells them to get ready for a fight. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | They began by asking, 'How can we stop what is coming?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body slowly came to life as it explained that there isn't a chance to stop what will happen now that it is in effect, especially with towers falling and the sword free. Their second question: 'How did you learn to seal [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explained that it was a method theory by the Dwarves long ago. Their third question: 'What are there options to seal Gods?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains that the only other way was through [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. However, they weren't powerful enough to contain the full power of the Gods. Their fourth question: 'Can we trust [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains, "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] does more for you than you will ever know. Why do we think [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] has left you alone for so long? Why haven't you had as much trouble? Maybe someone has been going ahead and dealing with big threats. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] cares for you like a farmer cares for a lamb being sent to the slaughter; he sees you as his best shot at winning. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] has a lot on his plate, and you are at the top of his priorities. [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] don't think this should be so." Finally, the fifth question: 'Where is [[Locations/The Desert/The Auditor's Headquarters\|The Auditor's Headquarters]]?'. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] explains they had a tower south of [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|The Great Wall]] in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. With that, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s corpse becomes quiet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, it does become clear what is happening, all of the black tendrils seem to be reaching out and congregating at a single point just above the palace. Chenris realises and says that they'll probably get answers to most of their questions if they can get closer to the palace and asks Korrigan if any of the thieves' routes lead to the palace, korrigan says there are and it would be quite easy to get to. The party hides the horse and cart nearby and makes their way to a hidden tunnel entrance. just as they enter, korrigan has a horrible thought that this could somehow be related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and does a quick check and is relieved to learn that nothing about this seems to be related to him.

Thinking back, Korrigan realises that when he is in or near a [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|tower]], it becomes difficult to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. he summarises the perfect place for them to stay would be in the tower since [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] would most likely be unable to reach Aidan, plus they could take the time to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. As they approach, discuss questions that they want to ask [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. The biggest one is "Are there any other ways to block out the Gods, even better if you could choose which Gods to block". Korrigan figures this would be a very important thing to find out before he falls the tower in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. They also want to find out more about [[Uti †\|Uti †]] and the island of [[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Korrigan casts the spell to talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and receives a warm welcome. He returns the warm greeting and remarks on how nice it is to talk to such an amazing being and asks if he could answer some questions he had. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] says he doesn't know everything but will endeavour to do his best to help. Korrigan asks if there is another way to stop the gods from interacting with the material plane. The God says he only knows of one other way to stop the Gods. It explains that pushing back something powerful requires a sacrifice of life. Korrigan asks for clarification on what he means by life and asks if they could use a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] in its place. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] explains that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|someone]] has already sacrificed themselves before, they bound themselves to [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] to stop the Gods during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. Legend has it that every 50 years this person is able to walk the planes but has to return very quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Korrigan then asks about [[Uti †\|Uti †]]. The God reveals that the dragon was a personal friend of his. The dragon was plagued with loneliness and had lost something very precious to them and spent a lot of its time searching for it. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] clarifies by saying they aren't sure what is exactly but they assume it's a mysterious weapon called the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]]. However, the being does not know more than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | Korrigan then asks about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and explains his theory about how Ebis might be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]]. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] explains that Ebis is a being that has been around for a long time and has worn many, many different faces. They don't know if Ebis and Lyrion are the same though. God does note that Ebis can be secretly bad even if he is very kind at the moment. Having answered all their questions, they say goodbye and Korrigan ends the spell and rushes to report everything he found out. He tells everyone, especially chenris about we had happened. Mordecai interjects and asks what is even happening, he feels very out of the loop and even left out of Chenris and Korrigan's little science group. Chenris is hesitant to let Mordecai join their group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
