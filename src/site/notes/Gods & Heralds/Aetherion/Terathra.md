### Overview
The name given to the being at the centre of the world. See [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] for more information. When he speaks to the party, he speaks in a very archaic and poetic way.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | With a kind smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that if they told them that, she could come into the dome. She nodded and said their God was called ' [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] ', and he was an ancient god. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if they were related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], and the women explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was much older than [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Entering the doom and sitting down, she explained that for Aetheorion, the God of life, to die, the concept of death needed to exist. [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was that concept. Kerrigan began to say they were good friends of the [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], but the women didn't seem to care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Once out of earshot but still being watched from afar, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exhaled, pleased that they had learned so many interesting things. They were particularly intrigued by the fact that Niaross significantly influenced the wall and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]], which could mean [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]] had something to do with [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] tried to sense Terathera's presence from the wall but couldn't detect anything. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], looking closer at the wall and then The [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]], tried to understand if anything was happening. As far as they could tell, the stone had been taken from the mountain range, but it was nothing more than regular rock. After a long pause, they assessed that it was probably sedimentary rock, but no geologists were around.                                                                                             |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] ignored her alarming comments and instead focused on telling her all about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and how they were sealed away and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]] were hurting them. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] explained that one of his goals in [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]] was to destroy the tower. Sylvia initially didn't believe him until he showed her the book he stole from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], which explained everything to her. After reading the book, she was immediately on board and wanted to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned. |
