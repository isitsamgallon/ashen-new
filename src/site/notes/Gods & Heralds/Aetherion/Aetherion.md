### Overview
The Primordial Divinity. In the beginning, there was one being: Aetherion, the All-Father. When he died, his body split off into eggs, which hatched into giant beings. The soul of Aetherion split up into different beings according to his emotions (Anger, Sadness, Hatred, Compassion, etc.), and they became the Ashen Pantheon]].

To protect themselves from the Gods, the beings hatched from the eggs and built shells around themselves. These shells became the surface of the planets in the universe. The earth [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are on, at the centre of it is a being, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]], whose tentacles were enticed up into [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] and then entombed. This being is known as [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]].

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] also seem to be able to drain the energy from Terathra, which is how it is possible to keep him contained. Terathra is also responsible for powering the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]] via [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] before [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | With a kind smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that if they told them that, she could come into the dome. She nodded and said their God was called ' [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] ', and he was an ancient god. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if they were related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], and the women explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was much older than [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Entering the doom and sitting down, she explained that for Aetheorion, the God of life, to die, the concept of death needed to exist. [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was that concept. Kerrigan began to say they were good friends of the [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], but the women didn't seem to care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned. |
