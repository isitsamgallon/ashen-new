### Overview
The Primordial Divinity. In the beginning, there was one being: Aetherion, the All-Father. When he died, his body split off into eggs, which hatched into giant beings. The soul of Aetherion split up into different beings according to his emotions (Anger, Sadness, Hatred, Compassion, etc.), and they became [[Gods & Heralds/Gods & Heralds\|the Ashen Pantheon]]]].

To protect themselves from the Gods, the beings hatched from the eggs and built shells around themselves. These shells became the surface of the planets in the universe. The earth [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are on, at the centre of it is a being, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]], whose tentacles were enticed up into [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] and then entombed. This being is known as [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]].

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] also seem to be able to drain the energy from Terathra, which is how it is possible to keep him contained. Terathra is also responsible for powering the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]] via [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] before [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]]              | With a kind smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that if they told them that, she could come into the dome. She nodded and said their God was called '[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]', and he was an ancient god. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if they were related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], and the women explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was much older than Aetheorion. Entering the doom and sitting down, she explained that for Aetheorion, the God of life, to die, the concept of death needed to exist. [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was that concept. Kerrigan began to say they were good friends of the Terathera, but the women didn't seem to care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20\|Session 20]]          | The temple is huge and made of white marble with magical crystals and bubbles floating around the large building. There is a small town located around the temple. Inside there are people in similar white robes likes in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the towers]]. Before going in, Chenris pulls Mordecai aside and tells him not to mention their involvement with the gods this time, since he would like to look around. Mordecai sheepishly agrees to stay quiet. Chenris talks to the receptionist and pretends not to know who the all-father is. The receptionist is very accommodating and would love to answer questions about the gods. In this temple, they worship all of the Gods, especially [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Curious, Korrigan asks about their opinions on the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s. They say they like the heralds of gods who are seen as peace-loving and kind like [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] however, the heralds associated with gods like [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] often come to death's destruction so they would be hesitant to invite this in. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]]          | Ignoring this, Mordecai starts to perform a self-written ballad about [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]] to wet their appetite. People seem to enjoy it and even chuck some coins at him. While this is happening, drache sits at the bar (which is unusual for this establishment), asks for a class of wine, and watches the crowd. After Mordecai finishes his first Ballad, he starts another about [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]; however, he purposely tries to get a lot of information wrong to see if anyone reacts. Most patrons are sitting there, enjoying the music -apart from one, an older man who starts disagreeing with many things Mordecai purposely gets wrong. Drache approaches him and they begin to chat about the true history of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Drache learns a lot and thanks him for his time. The person says, "No, thank you. It's been wonderful to talk about such things. If you wish to talk some more, just ask for [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] at the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]]" and then walks off.            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned.                                                                                                                |
