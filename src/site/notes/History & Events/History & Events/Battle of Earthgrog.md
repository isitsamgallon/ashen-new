One of the bloodiest engagements of the [[History & Events/History & Events/Eras/4th Era\|4th Era]]. It was a clash between [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Dhuggith Broadcloak †\|Dhuggith Broadcloak †]] and the remains of the [[History & Events/History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] near the toun of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]]. Despite the Grayfall's victory, the southern armies suffered catastrophic losses, with their ranks dwindling from 60,000 to a mere 150 survivors.
