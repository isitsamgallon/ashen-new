Originally devised by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Niaross †]], the [[History & Events/History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]], was an ancient and mystical barrier, had long been maintained by the magic of [[History & Events/History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]]. These pillars, scattered across the realm, were relics of a bygone age, their power waning with each passing century. [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]]'s scholars discovered that a concentrated burst of volcanic energy from [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]] could shatter this barrier, paving the way for [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]'s arrival.
