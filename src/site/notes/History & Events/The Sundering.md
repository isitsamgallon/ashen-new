+250+ Years Ago
+The Prophecy of the Cleansing Flame
+It was foretold by the first prophets of [[[[the Ashen Cult]]]] that [[Ignatius]] would one day descend upon the mortal realm to purify the world in his holy fire. Many memebrs of the cult worked tirelessly to prepare for this.

+250+ Years Ago
+A Breakthrough
+Cult Scholars found that the power of [[The Ancient Pillars]] was starting to dewindle and therefore the [[Skyfall Ward]] they up held could be broken with a concentrated blast of volcanic energy from [[Ember Peak]].

+250 Years Ago
+Start of The Sundering
+With the [[Skyfall Ward]] broken, [[Ignatius]] was free to enter the mortal realm.  [[The Ashen Cult]], steadfast in their faith, embraced their transformation into [[Ash Spawn]], eternal servants of his army.

+Soon after [[Ignatius]] arrived
+Forging of Weapons
+[[Ignatius]] forged mighty weapons from the molten minerals of [[Ember Peak]], chief among them the [[Firesoul Greatsword]]. 

+249 Years Ago
+War Breaksout
+The [[Ash Spawn]] army spread across [[the desert]], conquering villages and fortresses, turning the fallen into [[Ash Spawn]]. However, they did not attack [[[[Verdant Peninsula]]]].

+249 Years Ago
+[[The Coalition]]
+Seeing the chaos [[Ignatius]] had started in [[The Desert]], [[Ehobel]] and [[The Dawn]] created an aligence to fight the growing threat of [[Ignatius]]'s army. It was revealed that [[Caden SteelBreaker]] had fought in this war, with many saying it was some of his best work before he defected from [[The Dawn]] to the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]].

+~248 Years Ago
+The First Clash
+[[The Coalition]] and the [[Ash Spawn]] clashed for the first time. [[[[Seifer Willow]]]] commaned the [[Ash Spawn]] against [[General Midus]]'s forces and managed to back Willow into a conrner. Her [[Ash Spawn]] huddled closely around her, forming a living shield of fiery death. As [[the coalition]] army encircled them, Seifer unleashed the full power of [[Ignatius]], sacrificing herself and her comrades to obliterate the enemy. 

The lead to  [[Ignatius]] himself descended upon the battlefield, raising a new legion of [[Ash Spawn]] from the ashes of the fallen. As [[The Coalition]]'s numbers dwindled and the [[Ash Spawn]] ranks swelled, the aligence was starting to crumble.

+~248 Years Ago
+The Goblin Resistance's betrayal 
+Sensing the tides of war, the goblin general [[Chatiz]] sought to align his people with [[Ignatius]]. In a solemn act of devotion, [[Chatiz]] offered his eldest son to the Cleansing Flame, witnessing his transformation into an [[Ash Spawn]].

[[The Goblin Resistance]], now allies of [[the Ashen Cult]], disrupted coalition supply lines, weakening the resolve of their foes. The Goblin's knowledge of the land and their cunning strategies allowed them to sabotage [[the coalition]]'s efforts, hastening the fall of [[the Dawn]] Empire.

+~248 Years Ago
+The Final Stand
+As [[the coalition]] forces dwindled, [[Ignatius]] prepared for a decisive strike. The siege of [[Dawnhaven]], [[the Dawn]] Empire’s capital, was [[the coalition]]'s last stand. For four grueling months, the defenders held out against the relentless [[Ash Spawn]]. In a final desperate move, the remaining heroes launched a counterattack, carving a path through the enemy to confront [[Ignatius]] himself.

The battle against [[Ignatius]] was fierce and legendary. Despite their valor, [[the coalition]] heroes were no match for the god's might. However, through a clever ruse orchestrated by [[Galen Verix]] and [[Genevieve]], they created an opening. Galen, possibly aided by divine intervention or sheer heroism, struck a mortal blow to [[Ignatius]], piercing his heart and decapitating him. With [[Ignatius]]'s physical form destroyed, the [[Ash Spawn]] disintegrated, and their souls were freed.

[[Ignatius]]’s parting words were a dire warning: "You may have killed this physical form, but I will be back. Mark my words, you cannot kill a GOD." Yet, in that moment, [[the coalition]] had achieved a miraculous victory, bringing an end to the Sundering and paving the way for the Seventh Era.

+A New Foe in a Far Off Land
+After the events of the sundering Azeral the reaper of worlds, appeared out of no where and started slaughtering the ascended ones until there was only 5 left. Azrael used the dead bodies of the [[ascended ones]] to to fuel his army.
