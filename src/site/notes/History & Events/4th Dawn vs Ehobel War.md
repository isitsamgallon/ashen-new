A war that ended not long before the start of the story between [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. It was fought on the land that in the modern day is known as The [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. The Dawn refused to defended them and held the line at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. This lead to many of the residence of the area to grow distain for The Dawn so they broke ties with it and become the OFC. 

It is assumed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] also defected from The Dawn around this time but it is unclear exactly when this happened. Upon his defection, he soon became the leader of the armies and was known throughout the OFC as a powerful figure and as a beacon of hope of the ideals of the OFC.
