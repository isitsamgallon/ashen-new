### Overview
Aiden Knight is a human rogue and warlock, notable for his multi-class abilities in the realms of both stealth and arcane magic. He is a member of a party involved in the unfolding narrative of time distortion, initially coming to their attention during a significant temporal anomaly.  
  
### Background  
Aiden's past remains largely enigmatic, as he is reticent and speaks infrequently. His introduction to the party occurred amidst a large-scale time disturbance, where he demonstrated the unique ability to manipulate time on a small scale.  
  
### Abilities  
Aiden is recognised for his capability to close time distortions, a skill linked to his encounters with the deity Chronovorus. Subsequently, he made a pact with Chronovorus to enhance his control over time.  

### Personality
Aiden is a very quiet and reserved individual who seldom engages with The Party. He is particularly noted for his unique habit of sleeping in trees, a pursuit he often enjoys alone, rather than in the company of others. Additionally, Aiden exhibits traits of selfishness and self-centeredness, frequently striving to retain as much gold as possible for himself, which distinguishes him within the narrative. 

### Description
Aiden has platinum blond hair and brown eyes. He wears all-black clothing with a black hood. 

### Backstory Summary
Aiden's backstory hasn't been revealed publicly yet.
