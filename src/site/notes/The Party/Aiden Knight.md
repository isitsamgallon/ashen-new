### Overview
Aiden Knight is a human rogue and warlock, notable for his multi-class abilities in the realms of both stealth and arcane magic. He is a member of a party involved in the unfolding narrative of time distortion, initially coming to their attention during a significant temporal anomaly.  
  
### Background  
Aiden's past remains largely enigmatic, as he is reticent and speaks infrequently. His introduction to the party occurred amidst a large-scale time disturbance, where he demonstrated the unique ability to manipulate time on a small scale.  
  
### Abilities  
Aiden is recognised for his capability to close time distortions, a skill linked to his encounters with the deity Chronovorus. Subsequently, he made a pact with Chronovorus to enhance his control over time.  

### Personality
Aiden is a very quiet and reserved individual who seldom engages with The Party. He is particularly noted for his unique habit of sleeping in trees, a pursuit he often enjoys alone, rather than in the company of others. Additionally, Aiden exhibits traits of selfishness and self-centeredness, frequently striving to retain as much gold as possible for himself, which distinguishes him within the narrative. 

### Description
Aiden has platinum blond hair and brown eyes. He wears all-black clothing with a black hood. 

### Backstory Summary
Aiden's backstory hasn't been revealed publicly yet.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 35\|Session 35]]              | Soon after returning, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] set off for [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decided it would be best to find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Shoni Anofora\|Shoni Anofora]], rather than risk needing help from [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] again. He quickly discovered a tavern down the road where the bartender, a dwarf, was speaking simply while pouring drinks for various customers. When Aiden asked about Shoni, the bartender replied, “I’m no good at remembering. Do you have something to jog my memory?” Reluctantly, Aiden pushed a few extra coins across the counter, and the bartender began to speak more formally. He explained that he had heard of Shoni and that she was last known to be heading south. With another payment, he detailed that she was working in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|the Desert]], beyond [[Locations/The Desert/The Great Wall\|the Great Wall]]. Aiden thanked him for the information and returned to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]], who refused to believe him, citing the bartender's poor command of Common.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | Next thing he knew, he woke up in a lush forest filled with flowers and animals unknown to him, a rogue. He took a few steps before his keen senses noticed a lady walking past behind a tree. She gave him a coy smile and invited him over. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] instantly recognized her as a [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]; her features matched exactly how [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] had described her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | The judge called for silence in the court with a dismissive hand before diving straight into the proceedings, listing the crimes of [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]]: murder, theft, breaking and entering, international terrorism, racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder... The list went on and on, and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]'s smile never wavered. He seemed to take each charge as a point of pride. When the judge finally finished reading his extensive list, he looked at [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] as a teacher might look at a student caught cheating on a test. "How do you plead, boy?" he asked. "Guilty," Aiden replied meekly. The judge slowly raised his gavel high in the air, and as he did so, Aiden stole a glance at the God of Chaos, whose smile faltered for the first time, dissolving into disdain. Aiden didn’t even hear the mighty bang of the gavel; instead, his final moments were filled with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] snarking, “Coward.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 34\|Session 34]]              | Next, the man with the Warhammer was called to the stand. He recounted the attack by the possessed [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], with each sentence sounding like another nail in the coffin of Aiden's fate. The faces of the jury grew increasingly glum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Turning to [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], she lifted him by his throat before any of them could react and told him to keep his promise to become a better person. Scared out of his mind, he nodded frantically before she let him go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | Before they could do anything, they heard a loud bang and a lot of screams. Almost on impulse, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ran towards the screams with exasperated [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] struggling to keep up behind them. Running onto the streets, they found a possessed [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], who must have snuck away at some point when entering the city, now possessed by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who was firing beams of energy aimed to kill as many people as possible with at least a dozen already dead around him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | As soon as they did, their minds were filled with visions of war, anger, hate, death, and injustice throughout the world. A female voice began to narrate the rampant lies and hatred that infected this world and how it could also be solved with the power of a cleansing flame. As this happened, the island was shaken by a large earthquake that threatened to destroy the castle. Mordecai was about to pull away before what the voice said made sense, and they began agreeing. The voice started to talk about the people in their lives, like their father, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]], who would wash away the beautiful flames of justice. Mordecai leaned against the table, using [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2213-prestidigitation) to cause small flames to wrap and move through their fingers as one would with a coin; darkness seemed to cloud their face, obscuring their finer features. They mutter about how things could be better this way and give in to the irresistible urge to wear the crown. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] began to weave a spell while Korrigan drew his bow, ready to stop Mordecai from picking it up. At the last moment, Korrigan stopped and let his bow down - curious to learn what might happen. Noticing this, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] does the same, trusting that Korrigan might know something they don't. At the last moment, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] used his slow-time ability to rush over and grab the crown. He knocked it out of Mordecai's hand, leaving it to roll and clatter on the cobblestone floors. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used [[[Mage Hand\|[Mage Hand]]](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) to quickly grab it and lift it 35ft in the air. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 27\|Session 27]]              | As this happened, a golden portal opened next to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body. A man wearing a golden mask, accompanied by a golden dragon, appeared through it. They looked at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]]'s body, their expressions unintelligible, before sadly shaking their heads, then left. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] ran to Mordecai, whose injuries had gotten the better of them, and healed them back to consciousness. Mordecai suddenly awoke confused and asked why [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would be so kind to them after everything they had done and said. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaims that Mordecai was in need and that it is right to help people and is confused at the idea that someone would help those in need. Mordecai is grateful but aware that this isn't the whole story and there is something more. He used the [[Admin/Spells/Message\|message]] spell to ask if they knew Halfbie wasn't being entirely truthful, but they were off the hook because they healed him. They give Mordecai a smile as Korrigan and [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] come to heal Mordecai some more. At the same time, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|drache]] can't understand why [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Niaross †\|Uti]] had to die. With [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] no longer concentrating on Haste, exhaustion hit [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] like a train as he leaned against a nearby wall to steady himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 26\|Session 26]]          | As they're leaving the town, Mordecai questions whether they can deal with [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Chenris notes it would be best to wait to be with Drache again before attempting such a challenge. They all double down on their aim to investigate the Pyramid]]. Along the way Chenris spots a black bear and its cub and notifies the party, reminding everyone how dangerous bears are when it comes to their cubs. Korrigan casts [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship) but gets countered and he thinks the bear is ok and doesn't mean any harm and in fact, he should go pet them. Mordecai and chenris rebuke him. They manage to convince him not to go pet the bear and Mordecai minor illusion to make them look way bigger. The bear runs away in fear. They carry on and arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. As they are deciding on what to do in the town, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] reveals that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] had contacted him the day before to make a deal, however, he refused. They all hope this didn't piss off God.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]]          | For the last few days, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] has been travelling back to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to retrieve the horse and cart. However, as soon as he got to the stables time suddenly started to slow down until it completely halted leaving Aidan in an unmoving world. It was a very similar experience to the last time when he had to go to [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], the only difference was that this time there was a black mist that seemed to follow the road out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. With little else to do, he followed it, the mist took him into [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and to a fork in the road, one way would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] and the other would take him to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] the trail of mist seemed to want to to take him to Farpost. The thought of having to deal with something sinister alone terrified him so he opted to go to Dawnhaven and meet up with the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 24\|Session 24]]          | After the infiltration of [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] took a few days to rest and heal their injuries. Unfortunately, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] 's injuries were much more serious than originally thought, and she wouldn't be able to travel for a while and needed bed rest. Hearing this, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] informs the party that he'll stay behind and make sure she is safe and will catch up with them when she can travel again. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], for his part, left at night, leaving a note explaining he had gone off to investigate something and would join the party later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

[[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 22\|Session 22]]          | As they explored the ancient, almost hallowed halls of [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]], [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] spent some time investigating the incessant itching he had been experiencing recently. To his horror, he realised that it originated from the bite mark he received from the zombie squirrel [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|a few sessions ago]]. With no way to deal with the wound in the sprawling dungeon, he puts that information aside to focus on the door now in front of them. They inspect the door from traps, clearing the door of suspicion, he tries to open the door as quietly as possible. To his, and the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s horror, the door swung open with a bone-rattling screech alerting the [Mummies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16961-mummy) within. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] is unaware of this happening as he is still in the previous room looking for clues. However, the combined force of Korrigan, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] was more than enough to best a singular mummy, making short work of it. Unfortunately during the fight, the itch on Korrigan's arm made him miss the mummy and hit Mordecai in the chest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

They walk through the portal and encounter a room filled with clocks, all progressing at different speeds. At the back of the room, near the alter is a large time disturbance with a few crystals floating around it. Korrigan immediately recognises these as the very same ones that are found at the top of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]]. Aidan is too afraid to say anything so Korrigan says hi to the priest - and old, dishevelled man. He greets them and asks if there is anything they would like to talk about. They say they have a few questions about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. They say that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is a bad God and they want to know why he does what he does. The priest laments as he does not have the authority to answer that question. He does say that all of the Gods act on their own interests and what is best for them and [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] is the same. They ask who's authority he speaks of and just says that he is just a priest and wouldn't dare speak for the deity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Chenris notes it would be best to wait to be with Drache again before attempting such a challenge. They all double down on their aim to investigate the Pyramid]]. Along the way Chenris spots a black bear and its cub and notifies the party, reminding everyone how dangerous bears are when it comes to their cubs. Korrigan casts [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship) but gets countered and he thinks the bear is ok and doesn't mean any harm and in fact, he should go pet them. Mordecai and chenris rebuke him. They manage to convince him not to go pet the bear and Mordecai [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|minor illusion]] to make them look way bigger. The bear runs away in fear. They carry on and arrive at [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/Whitespire\|Whitespire]]. As they are deciding on what to do in the town, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] reveals that [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] had contacted him the day before to make a deal, however, he refused.

Chenris, Korrigan and Drache approach the The Empress' chambers and ask the guards if they've able to have an audience with her. He states that The Empress is not to be disturbed and isn't taking visitors.

Soon after their arrival, [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] sheepishly asked Mordecai if they wanted to talk to them about what happened in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]]. The rest of the party hide at the top of the stairs and ears dropped the conversation [Scooby Doo Style](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscoobydoomistakes.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F167541852875%2Fok-so-the-gang-is-investigating-a-mysterious&psig=AOvVaw1f50zPDYnXzion6KP0Sflp&ust=1715696520642000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCMDrlN_pioYDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). Aidan explained that he doesn’t know how to function outside of being a weapon to be pointed at others and explained how he was sorry since being locked up in that sell took him back to his childhood which is a very traumatic time for him. Mordecai ends up telling him that he needs to get his shit together and stop trying to push away from the group as they are there to help them and they hug it out. Korrigan [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|misty step]] into a the room to give him a hug as drache and chenris run off. Aidan cry’s himself to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] stabilises Aidan to make sure he doesn't die. Suddenly a goblin mage appears on top of a roof and then suddenly gravity becomes much stronger and all the party hit the floor. Chenris then had a realisation that this was Ancient goblin magic and used [[Other Information/Display Tags/Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic\|Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic]], as this was his second time using this feature, he was learning on the fly how to use it. The spell only works on one person at a time. He free Korrigan so he can use his bow to take down the mage but misses and has no more spell slots left. The mage also has now turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
