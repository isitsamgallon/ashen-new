### Overview
Kal was a human Rogue/ Ranger Multi-class that joined the party on [[Session 00]] when [[The Party]] were exploring the ruins of [[Balance Ranch]]. He is originally from [[Lost Haven]], but was known to have spent a long time in [[The Dawn Empire]]. He was known for his incredible skills with a bow and love for money. Quite often seen as very innocent to the world, Kal was incredibly secretive about his past and what he used to do. 

Kal was eventually killed by a Wyvern on the [[Verdant Spine]], near [[Steelwick]] where his soul was soon taken by [[Lorwyn]] and a deal was struck for Kal to come back as her [[Herald]]. Once resurrected as [[The Korrigan]], the party found him wandering the streets of Steelwick with most of his memories missing. Was played by [[Tom Brothers]].

### Description
Kal is described as always wearing a large, worn green hooded cloak. He had dusty blond hair and amber-coloured eyes. He wore leather armour that notably had scratched emblems of [[The Dawn Empire]]. 

### Backstory Summary
The first part of Kal's backstory hasn't been revealed publicly yet. 

After these events, Kal ran away to [[Dawnhaven]], where he was soon tricked into joining the [[Ivory Crest]] where he became their slave for over 4 years before finally breaking free with the help of [[Terence Witherfeather]]. After finally being free, he left The Dawn and soon found himself in [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|The Dawn]].

### Trivia
Kal notably wrote [[Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly]] with [[Thorn]] and [[Sera]].
