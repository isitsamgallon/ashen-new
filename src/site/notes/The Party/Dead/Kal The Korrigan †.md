   > "MY NAME IS KA1 THE KORRIGAN, HERALD OF LORWYN - AND YOU WILL NOW KNOW FEAR!!"<cite>[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] - [[Session Notes/05  Freedom's Flame/Session 44\|Session 44]]</cite>

### Overview  
Korrigan is a human-fey hybrid and serves as the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He is a multi-classed Ranger and Druid recognised for utilising a powerful lightning bow and fey magic. Initially, he joined [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] under the name [[Kal †\|Kal †]] but perished during a confrontation with a Wyvern on the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. Subsequently, he re-joined [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in a new form, initially devoid of most of his memories. Through interactions with reminiscences of his past, he gradually regained a significant portion of his memories. Korrigan shared a close bond with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], one of the few individuals capable of understanding him and discerning when he was untruthful. 

### Kal
#### Overview
Kal was a human Rogue/ Ranger Multi-class that joined the party on [[Session Notes/01 Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] were exploring the ruins of [[Locations/OFC/Balance Ranch\|Balance Ranch]]. He is originally from [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]], but was known to have spent a long time in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. He was known for his incredible skills with a bow and love for money. Quite often seen as very innocent to the world, Kal was incredibly secretive about his past and what he used to do. 

Kal was eventually killed by a Wyvern on the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]], near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] where his soul was soon taken by [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] and a deal was struck for Kal to come back as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]. Once resurrected as [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]], the party found him wandering the streets of Steelwick with most of his memories missing. Was played by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]].

#### Description
Kal is described as always wearing a large, worn green hooded cloak. He had dusty blond hair and amber-coloured eyes. He wore leather armour that notably had scratched emblems of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]]. 

#### Backstory Summary
The first part of Kal's backstory hasn't been revealed publicly yet. 

After these events, Kal ran away to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], where he was soon tricked into joining the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] where he became their slave for over 4 years before finally breaking free with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]]. After finally being free, he left The Dawn and soon found himself in [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|The Dawn]].
  
### Personality  
Korrigan is characterised as a generally happy and seemingly innocent individual who prioritises the freedom of others and the protection of nature. He is known for fiercely defending friends and allies, often desiring their happiness. Beneath this cheerful exterior, Korrigan grapples with inner turmoil as he seeks to reconcile his human past with his existence as a Fey creature and the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]].  
  
### Description  
Korrigan resembles [[Kal †\|Kal †]], the primary distinction being the presence of a large set of antlers protruding from the sides of his head.  
  
### Backstory Summary  
Kal's early backstory has not been disclosed to the public. Following initial events, Kal fled to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], where he was deceived into joining the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]], subsequently enduring six years of servitude before breaking free with assistance from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]]. After escaping, he departed from The Dawn and became associated with the Organisation of Free Cities. After his death, Kal awakened within [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] 's realm, where he negotiated a pact allowing him to return to life as the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] to complete unfinished business in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. In exchange, he is tasked with destroying one of [[Other Information/The Towers\|The Towers]] for her amusement.
