 > “You all annoyed me more than I ever thought possible… but you were also the greatest honour of my life. I don’t deserve the time we had, but I’m grateful for it all the same. The gods will judge you one day, but don’t let their arrogance weigh on you. Their sins outnumber your own a thousandfold... I know I was never a hero like any of you and probably never could be… but if this is how I make amends for my mistakes by giving my life so you can live… then maybe I can leave behind something more than just a trail of failures.

### Overview
Chenris Tallfellow is a Half-Eldarin who used to live and study at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. He was a Cleric/ Artificer Multi-class and was among the original 3 members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] that awoke in the dungeons of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]]. He is known for his sharp wit and even sharper tongue, Chenris was the brains of the party, often researching and figuring out solutions to whatever situation the party found themselves in. He was notability from a noble lineage, however, he refused to elaborate on how. Played by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]].

### Personality
Chenris is a know-it-all magic user with a pension to talk down to people who aren't as smart as him. This has often led him to clash with his fellow party member [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], as Mordecai wasn't book smart and preferred to talk to people instead. Chenris seems to know a lot about a wide and varied range of topics, If he doesn't know about something, he's very good at researching and knowing just where to look in a library to learn about the topic. However, there are some weird gaps in his knowledge - like how to walk in the right direction. Sarcasm often goes over his head and he often doesn't get sex jokes.

### Description
Chenris has a pale complexion and a long grey beard and hair. He was found wearing scale mail armour covered by a long and beautifully made black cloak. It was made from fine Elvin silk and had the words 'Per aspera ad astra' sown into the fabric with golden thread. Chenris was incredibly protective of his cloak and kept it in incredible condition until it was later ripped to shreds before [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. He later replaced it with a Cloak of Billowing he made himself. 

Chenris' appearance takes on the colourful form associated with the Eldarin when he is filled with incredibly strong emotions. Generally, Winter is associated with sadness, Spring with happiness, Summer with rage and Autumn with confusion.

### Backstory Summary
Due to circumstances that Chenris refused to elaborate on, the Tallfellow family fell from their position of Eladrin nobility and escaped to Strixhaven for safety. He showed incredible aptitude for academics and was admitted into Strixhaven University. He soon became close to one of his professors, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]]. 

Later on, Leotoris was one of the stewards on a field trip to a local dungeon. Chenris begged his beloved teacher to let him tag along who eventually relented and snuck him onto the trip. This trip was designed for a much more advanced class than Chenris so it was no surprise when he accidentally activated a trap. Leotoris dove in between them and the trap at the last second, sparing Chenris but leaving the professor with lethal injuries. With his dying breath, he passed Chenris [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]] and begged him to solve the problem on it. 

### Dossier Reports on Chenris Tallfellow
**Background Overview:**
In response to recent sightings of Chenris Tallfellow within the [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] campus, I have initiated a comprehensive dossier report to illuminate his history before and during his tenure at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] University.

**Family Background:**
Chenris Tallfellow's upbringing unfolded within the residential confines of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], marking the continuation of a storied lineage once steeped in Eladrin nobility. However, the Tallfellow family's illustrious legacy was tarnished by --REDACTED--

**Transition to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]:**
--REDACTED-- endeavoured to instil in Chenris the customs and traditions of Eladrin high society, including etiquette and martial training, in a bid to --REDACTED--

**Academic Journey:**
Upon reaching the age of enrolment, Chenris demonstrated exceptional aptitude, effortlessly passing the entrance examination. Assigned to the Silverquill house by his mother, Chenris's academic journey diverged from the traditional path of Eladrin nobility. Despite his familial aspirations for social integration, Chenris eschewed societal expectations, immersing himself in the pursuit of knowledge and magical mastery.

His academic pursuits encompassed a diverse array of disciplines, ranging from abjuration to conjuration, reflecting his insatiable curiosity and intellectual flexibility. Library records reveal Chenris's voracious appetite for learning, characterised by eclectic reading habits and a propensity for exploring diverse subject matter.

**Interpersonal Connections:**
--REDACTED--

**Catalytic Tragedy:**
The trajectory of Chenris's academic career was irreversibly altered by the untimely demise of Professor Leotoris during a field expedition. The circumstances surrounding the incident remain shrouded in ambiguity, but Chenris's involvement in triggering a fatal trap precipitated the tragic loss of his mentor.

Professor Leotoris's final directive to Chenris, coupled with the stark reality of mortality, catalyzed a profound existential crisis within the young mage. Faced with the impermanence of life and driven by a desperate quest for longevity, Chenris clandestinely delved into forbidden necromantic lore, breaching the sacred confines of the restricted section.

**Consequences & Expulsion:**
Regrettably, Chenris's unauthorized pursuit of forbidden knowledge compelled decisive action. In adherence to our institutional regulations, I made the difficult decision to expel Chenris from [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] University. His subsequent banishment from the realm of mortal academia underscores the severity of his transgression and the enduring repercussions of his actions.

**Conclusion:**
Chenris Tallfellow's academic journey, marked by familial discord, intellectual fervor, and tragic loss, illuminates the complex interplay of ambition and consequence within our esteemed institution. While his expulsion signifies a departure from the hallowed halls of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], the legacy of his tumultuous tenure serves as a cautionary tale and a testament to the enduring pursuit of knowledge amidst the tapestry of magical academia.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. I)
**Subject Overview:**
Chenris Tallfellow, a once-promising student of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], has recently embarked on a tumultuous journey, forming connections with a disparate group of adventurers. This report aims to document key events and interactions surrounding Chenris since his departure from the academy.

---

**New Associations:**
Chenris swiftly integrated into a diverse adventuring party upon leaving [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. His companions include [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], a troubled individual wielding magic and music; Wurinn "drache" fuuldrusch, a straightforward yet amiable barbarian; Kal, a rogue driven by financial pursuits; and Aidan Knight, an enigmatic rogue with peculiar access to small-scale chronomancy.

**Troublesome Beginnings:**
Chenris's journey commenced in the vicinity of the OFC, a region associated with the troubled Dawn Empire. Shortly after his arrival, he fell victim to a cult, only to escape captivity alongside his newfound comrades.

**Involvement with Divine Entities:**
[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] found themselves entangled in a divine conspiracy involving the god [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and his black cult. The primary threat became [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]], an agent of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Chenris and his associates, after a perilous journey, orchestrated a ritual to evade this formidable foe. The ritual required burning pages associated with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Haunter]], along with cherished possessions. Notably, Chenris deviated from the prescribed course by retaining an artifact linked to an unresolved matter with his former professor, Varitan Leotoris.

**Unresolved Dilemma:**
Chenris's decision to withhold the truth regarding his lingering attachment to a problem assigned by Professor Leotoris raises questions about potential consequences. The efficacy of the ritual remains intact, but the undisclosed divergence from the prescribed procedure leaves uncertainties about the long-term implications for Chenris and his adventuring companions.

---

**Conclusion & Recommendations:**
Chenris Tallfellow's journey beyond [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] has proven eventful and fraught with challenges. As Archmage and Headmaster, I recommend monitoring developments closely. The unresolved issue from his past and his deviation from the prescribed ritual may have repercussions yet to manifest. It is imperative to keep abreast of Chenris's activities and their potential impact on both his personal growth and the stability of our magical realm.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. II)
**Subject Overview:**
This dossier serves as the second report on the activities of Chenris Tallfellow, a former promising student at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], Academy of Magic. Given his increasingly erratic behavior and entanglements with dangerous entities, it is vital to maintain an updated record of his actions for potential intervention in the event of an emergency. This report outlines his recent ventures, including covert operations, encounters with forbidden magic, and the unsettling developments surrounding his association with the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] and other clandestine groups.

---

**Incident at the Council**
Subject was involved in a covert operation with companions [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] and [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]]. Successfully infiltrated council offices to gather intelligence. During the mission, subject located classified documents on territorial sales and troop movements, but inadvertently triggered an alarm system connected to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the Dawn Empire]]. This led to an escalation of hostilities between the Empire and external parties.

**Confrontation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]**
During a critical encounter with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], a potentially dangerous member of the mysterious group known as [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]], subject identified the use of forbidden magic and uncovered the truth behind the murder of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Despite the high-stakes scenario, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] escaped through a portal, leaving the subject’s group with partial intelligence. Subject showed notable strategic restraint, but the situation highlights a lapse in anticipating magical tracking mechanisms.

**Artefacts Discovery & Study**
During an expedition to a wyvern’s lair, the subject retrieved ancient dwarvish books from a mysterious hollowed-out cave. His obsession with the acquisition of magical knowledge became apparent as he focused solely on the artefacts, despite the loss of a comrade (Kal). His fixation on deciphering these texts superseded his regard for the group's emotional state following Kal’s demise.

**Involvement in Korrigan’s Transformation**
Subject became fixated on studying the entity known as "Korrigan" (a transformed version of Kal), engaging in extensive research into the connection between Korrigan and the deity [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. His behavior during this period suggests an unhealthy detachment from human emotion, treating the transformed Kal as a research subject rather than a comrade.

**Encounters with [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] Researchers**
During an expedition in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]], the subject encountered researchers affiliated with [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. Notably, he made attempts to conceal his identity from them, suggesting underlying issues of guilt or fear regarding his academic standing. Despite Mordecai’s provocations, the subject’s identity remained hidden.

**Failed Negotiations and Loss of Credibility**
Subject displayed poor negotiation skills while attempting to trade luxury goods with the Adventurer’s Guild. His tendency to overvalue his position and knowledge of magic detracts from his ability to effectively handle mundane matters, casting doubt on his leadership capabilities during missions.

**Investigation of the Burning Library**
Subject displayed extreme emotional distress upon encountering a burning library, resulting in a temporary mental breakdown. His attachment to knowledge, particularly to texts, presents a vulnerability in high-stress situations where the destruction of intellectual property is involved.

**Research into [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]**
Subject was instrumental in uncovering the duplicitous nature of the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] guild, though his reckless decision to investigate their premises nearly resulted in catastrophic consequences for the team. Despite warnings from allies, he proceeded to engage with dangerous elements of the guild, leading to the brainwashing of one of his companions (Drache).

**Interaction with Deities & Temples**
During visits to [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s and [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]’s temples, the subject was offered crucial information in exchange for forgetting his origins. His eventual decision to compromise knowledge of his family’s history reflects his growing ambivalence toward his past, signaling a significant shift in his values.

**Encounter with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]]**
In a subsequent encounter within the criminal underworld, subject’s behavior became increasingly erratic. His obsession with arcane knowledge pushed him to recklessly pursue information, leading [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] into a notorious establishment run by dangerous figures. His involvement in the rescue of [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] during this episode highlights his resourcefulness but also his growing disregard for personal safety.

---

**Concluding Observations**
Chenris Tallfellow exhibits an exceptional aptitude for magic and learning, with a natural inclination toward the pursuit of arcane knowledge. However, his emotional detachment and obsessive tendencies have led to frequent clashes with his companions and an increased risk of mission failure. His disregard for social conventions and personal safety when magical knowledge is at stake has resulted in strained relationships within the group, as well as numerous instances of poor decision-making in high-stakes environments. Further psychological evaluation is recommended to assess his long-term viability as an adventurer.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. III)
This report provides a comprehensive update on Chenris Tallfellow's recent actions and activities, following his previous report. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered various challenges, including an assassination attempt and a dangerous cult, before continuing their journey to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. Chenris, once a promising student at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], has displayed increasingly unstable behavior and involvement in hazardous situations, necessitating an up-to-date record for emergency reference. 

---

Following a chaotic encounter, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]’s efforts to manage a crisis came to a head. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]], [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] managed to neutralize [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] before any further harm could occur. Chenris Tallfellow took swift action to stabilize Aidan, preventing his death. However, the arrival of a goblin mage, who increased the gravity in the area, left [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] incapacitated and struggling.

Chenris, recognizing the use of Ancient Goblin Magic, attempted to dispel the enchantment. His efforts, though valiant, only allowed him to free one individual at a time. He succeeded in freeing Korrigan, who then attempted to attack the mage but missed as the mage turned invisible.

**Battle with the Goblin Mage:**
Chenris freed himself and collaborated with Korrigan to locate the elusive mage. Despite landing a few hits, their efforts were insufficient to subdue the mage. Meanwhile, Mordecai observed [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Mordecai's Backstory & Family/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] approaching with a legion of goblins. In a desperate bid, Chenris used [[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]] to teleport directly to the mage, but his Inflict Wounds spell missed its mark. Subsequently, the entire party succumbed to unconsciousness.

**Escape from the Goblin Mine:**
Our records show, that while they were unconscious, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] were transferred to a nearby goblin-ran mineshaft located under the Verdant Spine. Imprisoned and guarded by goblins, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] faced dire circumstances. Korrigan’s charm on one guard led to the other demanding the charmed goblin’s execution. Reluctantly, Korrigan released the goblin, sealing its fate. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was forced into labor, during which Drache unearthed unsettling eyes in the wall. Chenris utilized Thaumaturgy to simulate a cave-in, causing the goblins to panic. Drache discovered a hidden tunnel, leading the goblins to direct [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] down it.

**Planning an Escape:**
Mordecai and Drache conspired in Draconic, while Korrigan and Chenris communicated in Primordial. Their plan involved Korrigan summoning a bird, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]], for Drache to scout the area. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] revealed a group of 60 goblins and a precarious door leading to the outside. The door opened to a grim scene of dead humanoid slaves, underscoring the urgency of their escape. After the goblins passed, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] eliminated their captor and sent [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] back to retrieve their equipment.

Once their belongings were recovered, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] opened a portal to their gear, leading them to the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]]Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]]'s library. Using a secret exit from the captain’s quarters, they escaped unnoticed, emerging in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]].

**The Trial of [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]:**
[[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] lay deserted as night fell. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] headed to the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]], where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Boris Johnson\|Boris Johnson]] informed them that most residents were attending the trial of [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] for the murder of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord Ulan †]]. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] opted for rest, while Aidan searched for his missing horse and spent the night in a tree.

The following morning, Mordecai, still vexed with Aidan over past events in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]], used Hideous Laughter to topple him from his tree for amusement. Drache persuaded Mordecai to consider [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]’s plight, arguing that Steve deserved a second chance due to his misguided actions. Chenris, however, remained unsympathetic, believing Steve’s predicament was his own doing. Chenris and Korrigan visited the local library, where Chenris discovered a tome titled _[[Books, Documents & Artefacts/An Incomplete Guide to the Gods\|An Incomplete Guide to the Gods]]_ to further his knowledge about [[The Ashen Pantheon\|The Ashen Pantheon]].

To gain entry into the courtroom, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] donned disguises. Mordecai dressed Drache in drag and altered his own appearance using Disguise Self to resemble a tall, imposing human. Mordecai's accidental reference to Drache as his wife aroused suspicion in the racially prejudiced town. Inside the courtroom, they encountered [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] providing a character reference for [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. Mordecai’s defense speech won some support, but Drache’s attempt to persuade the audience led to many fleeing in fear, deepening Steve’s despair.

Korrigan burst into the courtroom, declaring that the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] was planning an attack on the city. His dramatic interruption hastened the trial proceedings, though Steve was still sentenced to execution. As they exited, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] provided a note detailing Steve’s cell location and a time for a planned breakout.

**Quest to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] and [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]]:**
[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] met [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], who suggested delivering a note to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] and gathering reinforcements from [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]] for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] opened a portal to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], expediting their journey. On the way, Chenris and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] struck a deal involving [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]]’s soul contract, leading to Chenris learning about [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] and Korrigan’s hidden agendas. Their navigation faltered due to Chenris and Korrigan’s leadership, but Mordecai corrected their course.

**Encounter with [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] Caravan:**
[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] encountered a [[Groups & Factions/Merchant Guild\|Merchant Guild]] caravan loaded with weaponry, but interaction was refused. Chenris noted the heavy guard presence and inferred the caravan’s destination was [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]].

**Arrival at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]]:**
Upon reaching [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Farpost\|Farpost]], the town was in defensive preparations. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] delivered their notes to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]], who mobilized troops for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]’s defense and planned to engage the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]]. Arez rewarded [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] financially and departed to organize his forces. Chenris scrutinized the battle map, taking note of troop positions.

**Return to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] and Aidan’s Confession:**
[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] returned to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] as night fell, settling at the [[Groups & Factions/Adventurers Guild\|Adventurers Guild]]. That evening, [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] confided in Mordecai about his inability to function outside of being a weapon due to a traumatic childhood. Mordecai offered encouragement, and a group hug followed, though Chenris and Drache excused themselves.

**Meeting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek the Wise]]:**
Chenris encountered [[Named Characters & Beasts/Merek The Wise\|Merek the Wise]] during a morning walk and, deeming Mordecai a “buzzkill,” chose to inform Korrigan. Korrigan, enraged, teleported Merek to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and tried to uncover his true name, which Merek refused to divulge. Despite Merek’s refusal, Korrigan eventually gifted him a token. Meanwhile, Mordecai prevented others from alerting the guards about Merek’s disappearance, spinning a tale of Korrigan and Merek’s private moment.

**Rescue Plan for [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]:**
With [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]’s hanging imminent, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] devised a rescue plan. Korrigan created a vine net as a safety measure for Steve’s fall. Mordecai used Disguise Self to pose as a guard and, along with Aidan, convinced the actual guard to leave. They freed Steve and revealed their escape plan.

**Unexpected Arrival of a Black Dragon:**
At 3 a.m., a massive black dragon sent by [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] arrived at the tower’s window. The dragon, unfamiliar with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]], allowed Steve, Mordecai, and Aidan to board. Chenris, stationed on the streets, distracted the guards as the dragon approached. Mordecai informed Chenris not to panic, as they were being rescued. The dragon subsequently picked up Chenris and Drache.

**Flight to the OFC and Meeting [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]]:**
The dragon transported [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]], where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] and the city of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] were preparing for battle. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] coordinated the defense efforts, while the [[Groups & Factions/Goblin Mafia\|Goblin Mafia]] attempted to strike a deal with her.

**Goblin Troupe Deal:**
After deliberation, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] decided to employ the goblins as sacrificial pawns, despite Chenris’s suggestion. The vote was 4-1 in favor of hiring the goblins, though [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] had to be physically coerced into signing the contract.

**Rest at the Minister's Rooms:**
[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] enjoyed a luxurious stay in the minister's rooms, complete with 24/7 baths. They overslept, and during the night, Aidan stole Chenris’s cloak, prompting a confrontation. Chenris, angered, led to a discussion about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]]. Aidan downplayed the issue, heading to the council room where [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] awaited.

**[[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]]’s Frustration and War Strategy:**
[[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] expressed fury over [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]’s oversleeping and the chaotic presence of various forces within [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. Chenris presented a comprehensive strategy: creating an impassable storm to thwart a sea attack, positioning trolls for a pincer maneuver, and using fairies to transform soldiers into dinosaurs for additional firepower. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] approved the plan, and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] boarded [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Kazzin\|The Black Dragon]] for the front lines. Mordecai delivered a stirring speech, with Chenris enhancing through Thaumaturgy.

---

**Conclusion:**
In the wake of their harrowing escapades, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]’s journey has revealed both their formidable strengths and their frailties. From the treacherous escape from the goblin mine to the high-stakes battle that determined the fate of the Organisation of Free Cities, Chenris Tallfellow and his companions have navigated a labyrinth of danger, intrigue, and moral complexity. Despite their occasional discord and individual flaws, their collective resolve and resourcefulness have emerged as their greatest assets. Chenris, in particular, has demonstrated a complex blend of brilliance and vulnerability, grappling with personal demons and unresolved pasts while striving to lead his allies through tumultuous trials. As they embark on new quests, their experiences thus far will undoubtedly shape their future decisions and alliances. The upcoming challenges in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]] and beyond will test their unity and resolve further, but with each step, they forge their path forward, their destinies intertwined with the fate of the realms they traverse.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. IIIV)
As is my growing concern with Chenris Tallfellow’s behavior and increasingly erratic decisions, I have accelerated the frequency of these reports. Each subsequent account uncovers more troubling patterns that suggest the once-bright student has veered ever further from the promise of his early potential. The following incidents, though varied in nature, illustrate a descent marked by moral ambiguity, reckless curiosity, and a disturbingly cold detachment from those around him. I remain gravely concerned about the trajectory of his actions and their ramifications on not just [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] but on the fabric of the multiverse itself.

---

**The Mimic Escape**
Chenris and his companions found themselves in a house entirely constructed of mimics, a fact that he deduced with alarming swiftness. It was a clever realization, yet the perilous environment demanded immediate action. Despite waking his slumbering allies in time, the situation escalated quickly as the house itself began a grotesque digestion process. Chenris’ tactical brilliance shone momentarily as he utilized *[[Admin/Spells/Misty Step\|Misty Step]]* to scout a path, but his quick decision-making seemed more self-preserving than selfless. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]’s narrow escape, in part facilitated by Chenris' coordination, was ultimately overshadowed by the violence that ensued. The mimic, locked and battling with his companions, was dispatched, but the question remains: why did Chenris, with all his intellect, not foresee the need for such a drastic exit strategy earlier?

**Arrival in [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]]**
Upon arrival in [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]], a coastal town, Chenris exhibited behavior far removed from his more academic roots. Inquiring about lodging, he slipped into an Elvish conversation with the receptionist, where he cavalierly referred to [[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] as his "slave." Whether this was intended as a jest or a more insidious revelation of his true thoughts is unclear, but the fact that he would employ such language in a casual manner is deeply troubling. The receptionist’s immediate direction to the slave quarters might have been the result of Chenris’ sharp tongue, but it was his willingness to play along that I find most disturbing.

The blood test that followed confirmed Chenris’ noble lineage—an unsurprising fact, but one that elicited unsettling behavior from his companions. In particular, his handling of the receptionist’s deference, addressing him as "Lord Tallfellow," seemed to feed his growing arrogance. His immediate transition into a luxurious pocket dimension raised more questions than it answered. What does Chenris intend to gain by flaunting this noble birthright, and to what end?

The luxury of their temporary lodgings was soon marred by a prank Chenris orchestrated. Angered by Aidan’s previous theft of his cloak, Chenris stole Aidan’s prized dagger and had a slave dispose of it via portal, ensuring its permanent disappearance. While pranks and minor acts of revenge are not uncommon in adventuring parties, the casual cruelty with which Chenris enacted this one is unsettling. He reveled in the discomfort it caused Aidan, making a mockery of the dagger's disappearance over breakfast while Aidan frantically searched for it. The cold calculation behind the prank suggests a growing callousness in Chenris’ psyche, one that could endanger the unity of his party.

**The Audience with Empress Yelris**
The manner in which Chenris and his companions sought favor with Lord Folre [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]] to secure an audience with Empress [[[[Obeus Yelris\|[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] Yelris]] continued to highlight Chenris' manipulative tendencies. While the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] flattered Lord [[Locations/Ehobel/Enelion/Enelion\|Enelion]], Chenris quickly capitalized on the favor and disengaged, moving away from the situation with haste. His use of social maneuvering is impressive, but it is the underlying intent that concerns me. Chenris has become adept at using people to advance his own goals, and I fear what this skill might evolve into, given time.

**Aidan's Dagger Scam in [[Locations/Ehobel/Nas Anor\|Nas Anor]]**
Chenris' involvement in Aidan's scheme to sell and then magically recall his dagger in [[Locations/Ehobel/Nas Anor\|Nas Anor]] further illustrates his willingness to engage in morally dubious activities. While his sale of wyvern poison might be deemed pragmatic, the overarching trend of behavior speaks to a growing detachment from ethical concerns. It is as though Chenris views every interaction, every decision, as a piece in a larger game—one where only the end goal matters, regardless of who might be hurt along the way.

**Lost in the Forest and Cannibal Encounter**
Once again, Chenris led the group astray, resulting in their encounter with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|elven cannibals]]. His attempt at broken Elvish, while arguably brave, revealed an unpolished grasp of diplomacy, one that left much to be desired. Yet even here, Chenris’ pragmatism won out. Through quick thinking and persuasion, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] escaped with their lives. However, the sheer recklessness of his decisions leading up to this encounter—his misplaced confidence in navigating the forest—nearly cost his party dearly. His growing sense of invulnerability is deeply alarming.

**The Tower of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]]**
It is in his obsession with towers like [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]] that Chenris’ most concerning qualities come to the fore. His academic curiosity has warped into something more dangerous, as demonstrated by the events at [[Locations/Ehobel/Saleh Tower\|Saleh Tower]]. Chenris' determination to dismantle the crystal despite Mordecai's protests was nothing short of reckless. The fact that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]], a man whose allegiance remains suspect, joined forces with Chenris to complete this destructive act only deepens my concern. By breaking the crystal, Chenris absorbed immense energy, a power that could very well have catastrophic consequences. His choice to ally with a figure like Ebis suggests that Chenris' pursuit of knowledge has blinded him to the moral and ethical ramifications of his actions.

**Conclusion**
Chenris Tallfellow’s journey thus far has become an ever-darkening reflection of the student I once knew at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. His brilliant mind, once a beacon of potential, now veers into dangerous territory—obsession, manipulation, and a disregard for the well-being of others. I will continue these reports in greater detail, as each step he takes seems to lead him further down a perilous path. The question remains: will Chenris realize the cost of his decisions before it is too late, or will his thirst for knowledge consume him entirely, along with those unfortunate enough to be caught in his wake?

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. V)
There is an unexpected solace in the matter of this report—an easing of my long-standing concerns about Chenris Tallfellow. While his recent endeavors have been punctuated by alarming tendencies, this latest chapter reveals faint glimmers of restraint and self-awareness. The city of **[[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]** presented an extraordinary challenge—its illusions tailored to exploit the deepest desires of its visitors, creating a potent trap that could easily have consumed anyone with unresolved inner turmoil. Yet, amidst this chaotic experience, Chenris displayed a degree of caution and skepticism that had long been absent.

I suspect these changes stem from the harrowing events in **[[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]**, though it is unclear if his newfound restraint is permanent or fleeting. What follows is an account of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]’s journey through the illusion-ridden city and, more importantly, Chenris’ pivotal role in unraveling its mysteries.

---

**Return to the Adventurers' Guild**
Upon their return to the Adventurers' Guild, the group sought much-needed rest. By morning, their usual camaraderie had resumed, albeit with the same undertones of rivalry. **[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]]** and **[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]**, ever mischievous, concocted a plan to outshine Chenris by busking for their breakfast. The intent was clearly to rile him—to provoke his competitive spirit. Naturally, Chenris, overhearing their schemes, responded predictably. However, instead of escalating the situation with overt trickery or confrontation, he chose to outwit them with subtlety. He ordered the most expensive meal available, complete with a fine bottle of wine. His demeanor, though still smug, displayed an almost playful restraint.

Mordecai, of course, was visibly irked by the success of Chenris’ counter-prank, but the exchange was devoid of the previous edge of malice. There is a peculiar softness to Chenris' victories now, as though he seeks to best his companions without truly damaging them—a nuance that gives me hope.

**Audience with the Empress [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]]**
The group’s next notable venture brought them to the palace of Empress [[Obeus Yelris]]. Despite her notorious unavailability, Chenris played a critical role in securing an audience. Alongside Korrigan and **Wurinn "Drache" Fuuldrusch**, Chenris' persistence bore fruit, convincing both the guards and eventually the Empress herself of the importance of their news. His handling of the Empress, however, showed an intriguing mix of formality and subtle challenge.

Addressing her with the respect due to her station, Chenris presented her with the threat of the bandit camp and the weapon known as **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Grom\|Grom]]**, using _[[Admin/Spells/Mage Hand\|Mage Hand]]_ to pinpoint critical locations on a map. Yet, when the discussion shifted to the fallen Tower of [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]], a topic of deep concern, Chenris showed uncharacteristic boldness, questioning the Empress' confidence in the tower's defenses. His tone was far from deferential—he hinted that the prior victory of [[Groups & Factions/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] had been mere luck, a remark that the Empress received with cold indifference. Still, Chenris’ insistence on presenting his own perspective, despite opposition, demonstrated a growing sense of responsibility.

Perhaps even more significant was his proposal of a trade deal between the **[[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]]** and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. A clear nod to Chenris' tactical mind, this suggestion was well-received by the Empress, who congratulated [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] on its recent victory. While his motives remain multi-layered, it was a rare moment in which Chenris seemed more statesman than schemer.

**The Empress’ Desire to Escape**
What followed was more troubling. The Empress confided in the group her desire to escape her gilded prison, and it was Chenris who immediately began plotting with Mordecai. Pulling him aside, Chenris requested his aid in infiltrating the palace, acknowledging Mordecai’s talents for distraction. When Mordecai questioned whether Chenris took him for a fool, Chenris' blunt response—"yes"—was emblematic of his typical, unflinching candor. Yet, this partnership hinted at a rare alliance born out of necessity rather than rivalry.

**The Palace Break-In**
During the subsequent break-in, Chenris’ **[[Other Information/Unique Items/Clockwork Bird\|Clockwork Bird]]** played a pivotal role. While Mordecai distracted the guards, Chenris used his bird to create the illusion that the Empress remained within her chambers, allowing the group to extract her unnoticed. His quick thinking and deft manipulation of magical constructs were crucial in the success of their plan. Though Mordecai and the others executed the distraction, it was Chenris’ strategic foresight that ensured the operation's flawless execution.

**Confrontation with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]**
Chenris’ inquiry into **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]]’** disappearance brought him to a perilous encounter with **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]**, a figure whose shadow looms larger with each passing event. The meeting quickly unraveled into a surreal confrontation, with Ebis transforming into various disturbing figures, including the leader of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]] and a familiar suicide bomber. The confrontation culminated in Ebis’ sadistic parting words: “And no one will believe you.”

Chenris, rattled, fled the scene—a rare moment of vulnerability for one so often in control of his emotions. His later attempts to make sense of the encounter were marked by uncharacteristic panic, and when **Korrigan** used magic to delve into Chenris’ mind, the revelation that their thoughts had been probed at some unknown point left the entire group shaken.

**[[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]’s Illusory Deception**
Upon their arrival, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was greeted by **[[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]**, a city notorious to the mages at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] for morphing itself to suit the current deepest yearnings of its visitors. The malleability of the environment—an obvious illusory enchantment—allowed each member to perceive a vision tailored to their specific desires. **[[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]]** envisioned a city of comfort, with hot springs and massage parlors to ease his newly discovered magical abilities. **[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]**, drained of arcane energy, sought mana restoration, while **Mordecai Reverence** saw a playground designed for thrill-seeking.

Chenris, however, was drawn to something more sinister. His recent fixation on the regenerative powers of the **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]]** led him to envision a “Magical Cannibal School,” where robed scholars eagerly handed him forbidden knowledge. Though alarming, this vision showcased Chenris’ obsessive need for knowledge—a trait that remains both his greatest asset and deepest flaw.

And yet, something subtle shifted this time. Unlike his previous reckless pursuits of forbidden magic, Chenris quickly sensed that the knowledge he was being offered in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]] was hollow, fabricated. He detached himself from the illusion with a wary mistrust, recognizing the danger it posed before the others did.

**Suspicion & Subtlety**
Chenris’ encounter with the head researcher in his illusory library proved pivotal. Upon receiving a tome purported to hold the secrets of the **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Elven Cannibals\|Elven Cannibals]]**, Chenris immediately grew suspicious. His newfound caution was evident in his skepticism—he did not blindly accept the knowledge presented to him. Instead, he tested the illusion, recognizing the excessive flattery as a manipulation rather than validation of his skills.

This moment of awareness is crucial. In the past, Chenris has been reckless, driven by the thirst for arcane power without regard for consequence. Here, he exhibited a maturity I have long hoped he would achieve. When he discovered the illusion's deception, he retreated and joined **Mordecai Reverence**, who had already broken free. Together, they hatched a plan to rescue the others.

**Illusions, Rivals, & a Dangerous Escape**
The rivalry between Mordecai and Chenris has been a source of tension within [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] for some time, and it threatened to flare once more as Mordecai reveled in having “outsmarted” Chenris. However, their collective goal of freeing their companions from the city's thrall took precedence over petty competition.

Chenris re-entered the illusory city and encountered a fake version of Mordecai, further confirming his suspicions of the city’s deceptive nature. Using his wits, Chenris tested the imposter with a specific query that only the true Mordecai would know, forcing the illusion to crumble before him. The fact that he did not fall prey to the charm of the illusion demonstrates a growing resilience in Chenris, one that might allow him to overcome the darker inclinations of his mind.

Outside the illusion, the situation became increasingly dangerous as **[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]** and **[[Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]]** remained ensnared by the false visions. Though Chenris and Mordecai succeeded in escaping the illusions themselves, they struggled to convince their companions of the reality. Korrigan, in particular, proved resistant—his paranoia deepened by the city's pervasive magic.

**The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]]: A Choice Presented**
The climax of the ordeal came when Chenris encountered the **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]]**, the malevolent architect of [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]’s ever-shifting façade. In a moment that could have revealed Chenris’ true nature, he was offered a tempting deal: remain in [[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]], where all his dreams could be realized, free from the constraints of reality. The [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]] promised protection and power—both tantalizing to someone of Chenris’ ambition.

Yet, Chenris did not accept. His skepticism, once again, overpowered his darker impulses. He rejected the offer, citing the artificial nature of the peace being offered. While I do not doubt that Chenris’ desire for knowledge and power remains strong, this moment reveals that he is not beyond hope. He may yet possess the discernment to distinguish between genuine growth and hollow shortcuts.

**Consequences & Strained Alliances**
Upon reuniting with his companions, Chenris found **Mordecai Reverence** drenched in the blood of [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|elves]]—an unsettling result of the **Ethertwist Haunter’s** manipulations. Tensions flared as the group quarreled over a mysterious note, **Leotoris’ Last Problem**, a matter that Chenris has obsessively guarded. When **[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]** attempted to destroy the note, Mordecai intervened, taking an arrow for it and falling unconscious.

Chenris, though clearly shaken, healed Mordecai—an action underscored by his sarcastic comment about the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Illusion Master\|Illusion Master]]’s intentions. This was not an act of compassion, but rather a calculated and spiteful decision to avoid proving his adversary’s grim predictions correct. Nonetheless, Chenris' ability to weigh the broader consequences of his actions is a positive development.

**Arrival in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|SIlkhorn]]**
After the dramatic conclusion of the events in **[[Locations/Ehobel/Caalona\|Caalona]]**, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] heads toward the bustling docks of **[[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]]**, where **Wurinn "Drache" Fuuldrusch** awaits. **Mordecai Reverence**, eager to reconnect, rushes to embrace Drache and recount their harrowing adventures. Meanwhile, **[[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]]**, ever meticulous, creates a list of the group’s priorities titled "What good in the world can we do?" The first task: aiding Drache in breaking **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]** out of captivity.

As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] begins to navigate the streets of [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], an unsettling atmosphere greets them. The townsfolk, eerily cheerful and clad in uniform brown robes, prompt concern. **Chenris Tallfellow**, ever curious but growing clumsy with his rising self-doubt, causes a small commotion by accidentally pulling down a passerby’s trousers while attempting to investigate. His muttered apology—“Can’t do anything right these days…”—betrays the inner turmoil gnawing at him.

Their destination is **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]]**, whose recent close association with **[[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]** might provide answers. Bridges, unusually upbeat, directs them toward **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]**'s church, a place they haven’t visited since leaving the town. When they arrive, the scene is surreal—what was once a modest sanctuary has transformed into a grand temple, with Steve himself leading a choir of worshippers singing hymns in [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]’s honor. The disturbing undertones are undeniable, and both Mordecai and Chenris seem haunted by the morality of what they've unleashed.

The most jarring revelation comes when **[[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]** joyfully explains that after executing **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]**—their racist enemy—he subjected [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]]’s followers to an “exposure therapy” experiment by locking them in a room with individuals of other races. **Mordecai** and **Drache**, alarmed by the ethical implications, quickly lay out the dangers of unchecked power: executing someone for their beliefs, forcing social change without consent, and the perils of glorification. Chenris, recognizing the merit of Steve’s attempt to address social division, nevertheless finds himself walking a fine line—acknowledging Steve’s idea but urging more humane methods.

Before leaving, they inquire about **[[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]]**, who has mysteriously vanished. With few leads, they set off for **[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]**, where another unsettling mystery awaits.

**Whispers on the Wind**  
Chenris, while journeying through the countryside with his party, reported hearing unsettling whispers—"Brainsssss"—on the wind, a harbinger of dark forces. The normally vibrant woodland was eerily quiet, its stillness broken only by the macabre discovery of a dead bird, its brain removed with surgical precision. This disturbing scene grew worse when Drache detected the presence of four undead entities hidden in the branches of a nearby tree. The creatures, upon closer examination, were revealed to be undead squirrels, an absurd yet horrifying manifestation of necromancy, with one such squirrel wielding a staff imbued with dark power. Korrigan, with his usual unorthodox methods, used his talents to speak with the leader of the undead rodents. The squirrel spoke of a plan—grandiose in its absurdity—to amass riches through robbery, a notion that seemed more pathetic than dangerous.

Chenris, however, did not falter. In the ensuing exchange, when negotiations broke down and a squirrel thrall attacked, he deftly used his [[Admin/Spells/Mage Hand\|mage hand]] to steal the necromantic staff from its diminutive wielder, bringing a swift end to the encounter. Yet, it is troubling to note that Chenris's proficiency with dark artifacts is growing. He is increasingly comfortable in wielding such items, and his ease in resolving the situation through manipulation of necromantic power leaves me uneasy. Still, the group moved on to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] without further incident, but the whispers, both literal and metaphorical, continued to linger.

**The Disappearance of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]]**  
Upon arriving in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] sought respite at a tavern, "[[Groups & Factions/Ye Old Tavern Down the Road\|Ye Old Tavern Down the Road]]," and it was here they began to gather information about the recent disappearance of one [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]]. Rumors in the city swirled like smoke, suggesting that Horrigan had somehow managed to steal everything from the palace, even the very furniture, all while the guards were mysteriously absent. The audacity of the crime, and the magical potential it would require, immediately raised suspicions within Chenris.

The investigation led [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to the palace itself. What they found there was a scene of such total desolation that it almost defied belief. The palace had been utterly stripped—every valuable, every gilded trimming gone. Chenris led the charge, uncovering a secret entrance in the palace vault, hidden beneath the surface and leading to a maze of tunnels. Mordecai, ever the opportunist, was sent forward to explore these narrow passages. His discovery of mining tools, oil lamps, and [[Gold\|Gold]] coins indicated a sophisticated operation, but there was more to uncover.

**Hidden Knowledge and [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the Black Tower]]**  
While the others searched the palace, Chenris wandered into the forbidden section of the city’s library. There, amidst the dust-covered tomes of forgotten knowledge, he found a book detailing the history of [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], one that linked it to the ancient [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]], a dwarven stronghold from ages past. The city’s history was one of desperation—siege, secret escape tunnels, and ultimately, collapse. The book, cryptic though it was, pointed Chenris toward the beach where the old tunnels may yet lead, and perhaps where the stolen goods had been taken.

The discovery of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]], barely alive with two daggers plunged into his chest, deepened the mystery. His story was one of betrayal, claiming that the dwarves—long dead or thought to be—had double-crossed him. Yet there were no signs of struggle, no evidence of the violence he described. The inconsistencies gnawed at Chenris, his intellect unraveling the threads of the tale, but the truth remained elusive. They healed Horrigan, stabilized him, and hid him within the council chambers, but there was no resolution. The specter of treachery haunted every step they took, and the tunnels beneath [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] held their secrets tightly.

**A Ghost’s Tale & the Crown of True Sight**  
Back at the library, the research continued. Korrigan searched in vain for information on "[[Locations/Itone Isles\|Itone Isles]]," but Chenris's sharp eyes and insatiable curiosity led him to another book—The Chronicles of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]]. There, among the notes of a once-great dwarven civilization, he found the ramblings of a former dean, Enel Cubus. His writings, erratic and filled with madness, referenced places of interest: [[Locations/Eldertide\|Eldertide]], [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], and a mysterious group known as [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]]. This discovery seemed to unsettle Chenris further; there are echoes of something larger at play, pieces of a puzzle that Chenris is keen to solve, though at what cost remains unknown.

Seeking additional knowledge, the group sought out [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]], an old adventurer with a reputation for knowing strange artifacts. His tale of a ghost messing with his mind seemed to resonate with Chenris, who appeared increasingly fixated on the nature of perception and reality. Terence spoke of the Crown of True Sight, a legendary artifact that allows its wearer to see the world as it truly is—an object of immense power, and one Chenris's growing ambition may find irresistible. Terence suspected that the crown may now be in the possession of either [[Named Characters & Beasts/Jub\|Jub]] or [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Chatiz\|Chatiz]], but Chenris appeared more focused on the possibilities it represented than on the details of its current whereabouts.

---

**Concluding Thoughts**
The events chronicled here mark a significant chapter in Chenris’ story—a chapter filled with growing internal conflict. His deft maneuvering during the audience with the Empress, his strategic brilliance in planning the escape, and even his handling of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]], all show a mind wrestling with forces far greater than mere academic curiosity or self-interest.

For now, I am cautiously optimistic. The young man who once sought only knowledge for its own sake now moves through the world with a heavier sense of responsibility. I will continue to observe him closely. His trajectory, though still fraught with peril, has taken a turn that brings me a modicum of relief. But whether Chenris Tallfellow will find his way back to the light, or fall deeper into the shadows that now encircle him, remains an open question.

As Chenris and his party prepared to leave [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], their path led them toward [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]], but the shadow of the past followed closely behind. Chenris’s thirst for knowledge, particularly of the arcane and the forbidden, grows unchecked. His quick thinking and mastery of magic have proven invaluable, yet there is an unease surrounding his choices—the books he reads, the artefacts he covets, and the dark forces he confronts with increasing frequency.

The line between curiosity and obsession is thin, and I fear that Chenris is beginning to blur that line. His once-bright potential is now shadowed by the weight of the knowledge he seeks. I will continue to monitor his progress, though I fear that his journey may lead him into dangerous waters, where even I may not be able to reach him.

### Trivia
- Due to a series of misunderstandings, Drache ships Mordecai and Chenris - much to their dismay 
- Chenris and Drache have a card game they always play when the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is busy. The card game is loosely based on Blackjack but was engineered by Chenris so that he could win nearly all of the time. Sometimes Chenris lets him win so they keep playing. 
- Chenris is known to have an absolutely horrible sense of direction. Often times [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] will say they want to go somewhere and chenris will confidently walk in the opposite direction. He often tried to play it off as he was testing them due to his pride. Mordecai has defaulted to putting some kind of lead on chenris so he can't just randomly walk in a direction.
	- Rowan has pointed out that Chenris' lack of direction is inspired by [Zoro from One Piece ](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Roronoa_Zoro), however this isn't true. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] forgot about that and thought it would be funny at the time. he has since made it a bit more like Zoro's directional skills.
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] had been planning Chenris' betrayal during [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Ritual\|The Black Ritual]] for months before it was finally revealed to the party during [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10\|Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 10]]. Sam also talked about it outside of the game to taunt and make sure no suspicion was on him before the reveal. 
- The reason why Chenris' note has a lot more time put into it is that [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] uses it as a summary of all their adventures as well to keep [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] relevant in the background.
