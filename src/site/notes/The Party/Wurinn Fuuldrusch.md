### Overview
Wurinn Fuuldrusch, or more commonly known as 'Drache', is a white [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. It is currently unknown where he is originally from, but he spent the majority of his life serving in [[Groups & Factions/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]]. He is a Barbarian/ Paladin multi-class and was among the original 3 members of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] that awoke in the dungeons of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]]. He is known for being honest and good to fault and is often seen as the party's moral compass. He is also physically the strongest out of the party, often being left to do most physical activities. Played by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]].

### Personality
Drache is an incredibly kind and honest person, often trying to resolve conflict more peacefully before resorting to violence. He will often stand up for people when they're being bullied and will normally try to see the good of everyone, despite their actions. Growing up in a fort, he is quite gruff and to the point. his time at the fort has also made him a very honourable man, who prefers to not sneak around, opting to tackle a challenge head-on. He is also known for not being the most intelligent in the party but he is extremely good with people. 

He is a charismatic and albeit somewhat flirtatious character whether he intends to or not and has a way of sweet-talking various characters, if all else fails he can tap into his more aggressive side and utilise his size to be more of an intimidator, however, he will rarely use this.

### Description
Drache is an incredibly tall, 46-year-old white [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who can often be found wearing heavy Half-Plate armour and wielding heavy weapons like Great-axes and Greatswords. 

### Backstory Summary

Emmeline was a soldier from a rival fort called [[Groups & Factions/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. After secretly sending each other love letters for a while, they both decide to desert their posts to try and live a life together. However, on their journey to meet up, Drache was kidnapped by [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]] delaying his reunion and leading to Emmeline's capture by Tulan Fort.
