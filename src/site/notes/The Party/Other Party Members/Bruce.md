### Overview
Bruce is A Dwarven automaton found in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]] under modern-day [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. Bruce seemed to be one of the original caretakers of the city, chasing off invaders and supporting the dwarfs and other automatons where needed. As [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|The Cleansing]] carried on, many of the Dwarfs died or moved to [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] and Bruce was left to take off the city by himself until [[The Party/Other Party Members/Corvus\|Corvus]] moved in.

He was finally rediscovered when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] accompanied [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] researchers to explore what they thought was an Ancient Dwarven Stronghold. The party immediately took a liking to him, especially [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]],  and decided to take him on to journey with them. 

### Personality
Although Bruce is an automaton, the extended period of time where he was left alone has caused many bugs in his coding and construction, leading him to his own personality. Bruce is sweet, endearing and kind of awkward but is incredibly energetic in whatever he does.

### Other Information
- Originally Bruce was only powered by lava that was pumped into him from a hose, severally limiting his operation time and where he could go. Chenris was able to create a semi-functioning battery for Bruce so they could take him to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] to fit him with a proper engine. 
- Researchers managed to fix an airship core to him giving him an abundance of power but also making him slightly buoyant in air, requiring him to be weighed down with heavy metal plating. 
- He has been travelling with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as a [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|Companions]] ever since.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]]              | They soon reached [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Old Earthgrog\|Old Earthgrog]]. It was an old-fashioned mining town swarmed with Automatons similar to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] suddenly felt very nostalgic again and immediately approached one and said hi. The Automaton outputted an error. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] then tried to say hi in ancient Dwarvish. The Automaton immediately looked their way and asked if the fighting would soon continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 39\|Session 39]]              | Suddenly remembering the opportunity they had, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] inquired about how [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]] and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] were doing. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] quickly chimed in with his concern for his girlfriend's safety. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] dismissively assured them that both were fine and currently out roaming the world, helping people. He did stress that they were swamped with work, which was why they hadn't had the time to check in with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]]              | When everyone was back together, they decided to go do some research. The library had nothing they didn't already know, so Mordecai and Drache resolved to talk to people. They decided that their best bet would be to go to the researchers who helped fix [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]][^5]. Entering the engineering room, one of the researchers greeted them warmly, half-joking that they hoped [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] was still operational and took great delight in the fact that he was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | Meanwhile, the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] followed the researchers to a laboratory bustling with arcane energy. There, the researchers proposed integrating the core of an airship into [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]], the automaton companion, to restore his mobility. As tools clinked and diagrams were drawn, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] was temporarily retrofitted, allowing him to float gently above the ground. The sight of [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] tethered like a balloon brought laughter, but the mood turned serious as the researchers explained the intricacies of the task. Full integration would take time and skill, and while the researchers offered their services freely, success was not guaranteed. Reluctantly, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] left [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] in their care, trusting in their expertise. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 04\|Session 04]] | Korrigan breaks from the party to go to the room with the rations and bumps into a shadowy figure that he tries to befriend. It turns out that this figure has been living in the stronghold for a while to stay away from humans. He also warns not to get in [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] 's way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
