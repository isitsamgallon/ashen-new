### Overview
Bruce is A Dwarven automaton found in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Iron Forge\|Iron Forge]] under modern-day [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. Bruce seemed to be one of the original caretakers of the city, chasing off invaders and supporting the dwarfs and other automatons where needed. As [[History & Events/The Cleansing\|The Cleansing]] carried on, many of the Dwarfs died or moved to [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] and Bruce was left to take off the city by himself until [[The Party/Other Party Members/Corvus\|Corvus]] moved in.

He was finally rediscovered when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] accompanied [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] researchers to explore what they thought was an Ancient Dwarven Stronghold. The party immediately took a liking to him, especially [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]],  and decided to take him on to journey with them. 

### Personality
Although Bruce is an automaton, the extended period of time where he was left alone has caused many bugs in his coding and construction, leading him to his own personality. Bruce is sweet, endearing and kind of awkward but is incredibly energetic in whatever he does.

### Other Information
- Originally Bruce was only powered by lava that was pumped into him from a hose, severally limiting his operation time and where he could go. Chenris was able to create a semi-functioning battery for Bruce so they could take him to [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] to fit him with a proper engine. 
- Researchers managed to fix an airship core to him giving him an abundance of power but also making him slightly buoyant in air, requiring him to be weighed down with heavy metal plating. 
- He has been travelling with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as a [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|Companions]] ever since.

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | Meanwhile, the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] followed the researchers to a laboratory bustling with arcane energy. There, the researchers proposed integrating the core of an airship into [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]], the automaton companion, to restore his mobility. As tools clinked and diagrams were drawn, [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] was temporarily retrofitted, allowing him to float gently above the ground. The sight of [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] tethered like a balloon brought laughter, but the mood turned serious as the researchers explained the intricacies of the task. Full integration would take time and skill, and while the researchers offered their services freely, success was not guaranteed. Reluctantly, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] left [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] in their care, trusting in their expertise. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 04\|Session 04]] | Korrigan breaks from the party to go to the room with the rations and bumps into a shadowy figure that he tries to befriend. It turns out that this figure has been living in the stronghold for a while to stay away from humans. He also warns not to get in [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bruce\|Bruce]] 's way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
