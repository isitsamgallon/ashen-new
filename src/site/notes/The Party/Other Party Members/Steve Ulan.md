### Overview
Steve Ulan was found in one of the cells in the dungeon of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]] at the start of the campaign. When he was first found he was incredibly racist and had many gaps in his memory. As he adventured with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] it was eventually revealed that he was the son of the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord of Steelwick]] and had run away years ago. 

The majority of his memories returned when the party journeyed to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|steelwick]] and explored his room and the dungeons. In the dungeons, he learnt that his father had tortured and murdered his girlfriend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mistrel †\|Mistrel †]]. This filled him with rage and led him to murdering his father and go to trial for it.

### Description
Steve is described as a bland bland-looking human with a receding hairline and no remarkable features. 

### Personality
Initially, Steve was unreliable and quite racist, especially since [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was comprised of many different races. Over time he grew to be more tolerant and even started to idolise the party due to the acceptance of him and actions due to [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], going as far as to create [[Groups & Factions/The Hero Cult\|The Hero Cult]].

### Other Information
- Steve isn't a very good fighter but tries hard to not be a burden to the party and his friends.
- He travelled with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as a [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|Companions]] for a long time before being left in the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|OFC]] to manage the cult and other affairs while they're not in the country

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 08\|Session 08]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are traveling to [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]] to try and find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] to free [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] from his contract with the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]. Along the way they make a stop at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]]. As soon as they enter the small village they are taken in by [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|DUstwood]] guards to a questioning room. Through being questioned [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] find out that [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] has murdered his father [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord Ulan †]]. He is currently on trail and facing an almost certain death sentence. However, according to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] law, all known associates of the murderer involved in the murder of lord are responsible for the murder of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord Ulan †]] and will also receive the same punishment.                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | They climb the mountain to try to find the Wyven's lair. The group reasons that this is what Kal ‡ would’ve wanted. The group eventually find it - it's not a naturally occurring cave, more like it was hollowed out long ago. The lair is full of bookshelves with ancient books written in ancient dwarvish. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] takes one of the books for further study and in the hopes of learning the language. Mordecai Reverence recognised the language from his travels. This language is found all over the cave and even on the four pillars that are holding up the cave. The group decided that it was best to leave for Steelwick to learn not only more about the books but also about what was going on with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]].                                                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | They decide to go to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's family home and Learn more about him. Theyre stopped by and old and gross farmer who is VERY horny. Korrigan strikes a say pose but that doesn't do it for the groundskeeper, explaining that he more into "studs". After putting on some make-up, [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] give it a go and is successful in getting past the grounds keeper. (Dm dies a little inside)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | We meet [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's Dad and he is a raging arsehole. He is very dismissive and hatful towards Steve and is even unaware of what he has been doing for the last few years, thinking Steve is still in his room after all this time. The party scam the nobel into giving them gold to check on Steve. They venture to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's old room & find [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]] wanting to talk to them, teasing them about how doesn't know who he is and then disappears into another portal, after telling them that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix ‡\|Galen Verix ‡]] of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] wants to see them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | The party decide to explore the castle, finding [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] 's diary detailing how in his childhood his father wasn't such a dick to his son, but actually quite good. There was a picture of Steve's mother as well but not much else. Although things seem idealic, investigating his room said otherwise when an ornate dagger was found under his bed and bedsheets out the window - an obvious escape plan. Steve is very confused. They leave his bedroom venture down to the basement find an old torture rack with a prison containing a little girl's dress and a bunch of love letters to Steve from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mistrel †\|Mistrel †]]. Upon reading the letter, Steve flys into a murderous rage aimed at his father. Mordecai uses minor illusion to make it look like the door disappears to give them time to talk him down.                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] | Getting the boarder of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] runs into some guards that recognise [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] as part of a local nobel family. The only way for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to get through is by saying [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is a pat of Steve's entourage - meaning they don't need any documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 01\|Session 01]]      | We start mid combat in [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Woods\|The Black Woods]] where the weird zombie man summoned [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]] after stealing [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Pages\|The Pages]]. [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] has two pages so he escaped out through the window. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] misty steps to join Drache. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]], while trying to defend [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] gets impaled by the The Ethertwist Haunter and is downed. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] had a moral breakdown and leaves without grabbing Steve, asking someone else to get him because he acknowledges he is a Squishy motherfucker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Inside the mansion, they encountered a spectral old man clutching a page and an infant’s decayed body. Using illusions, Mordecai tricked him into relinquishing the page, but the man’s anguish summoned [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]]. The battle was brutal; the Haunter’s incorporeal form resisted their attacks, and [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] fell to its tendrils, his screams echoing through the cursed halls. Drache and Chenris managed to retrieve the page, while Kal’s near-death forced Aiden to act swiftly, saving his life. The group escaped through a flaming breach, leaving the mansion to burn as [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] mages arrived to extinguish the blaze. Their silent judgement weighed heavily on Chenris, a haunting reminder of his past. Weary but resolute, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] moved forward, knowing their perilous quest to banish the Haunter was far from over. |

### Trivia
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] James originally planned for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to kill Steve because he was so racist and so had to quickly develop a back story for him since [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] showed no sign of letting him go. >:)
