### Overview
Steve Ulan was found in one of the cells in the dungeon of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]] at the start of the campaign. When he was first found he was incredibly racist and had many gaps in his memory. As he adventured with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] it was eventually revealed that he was the son of the [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lord Ulan †\|Lord of Steelwick]] and had run away years ago. 

The majority of his memories returned when the party journeyed to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|steelwick]] and explored his room and the dungeons. In the dungeons, he learnt that his father had tortured and murdered his girlfriend [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mistrel †\|Mistrel †]]. This filled him with rage and led him to murdering his father and go to trial for it.

### Description
Steve is described as a bland bland-looking human with a receding hairline and no remarkable features. 

### Personality
Initially, Steve was unreliable and quite racist, especially since [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] was comprised of many different races. Over time he grew to be more tolerant and even started to idolise the party due to the acceptance of him and actions due to [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], going as far as to create [[Groups & Factions/The Hero Cult\|The Hero Cult]].

### Other Information
- Steve isn't a very good fighter but tries hard to not be a burden to the party and his friends.
- He travelled with [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as a [[Groups & Factions/Companions\|Companions]] for a long time before being left in the [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|OFC]] to manage the cult and other affairs while they're not in the country

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 40\|Session 40]]              | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], seeing an opportunity to get [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the black tower]]'s [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] back, explained that there was some fighting and Automaton needed to meet them at [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. The Automaton didn't recognise the name, so [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had to explain where they needed to go with directions. Once the Automaton understood. It and every other Automaton began marching to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly stuck a note on one addressed to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] explaining all of this and to wait for them to get back to start trying the [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] and [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Korrigan]] were very uncomfortable with this but soon saw there was nothing they could do but order them to direct them to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. The cult guided them there, with many rushing ahead to clear the paths and roads to line by the door like a king's guards would. Along the way, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] asked [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] what they thought about all of this, to which she said she thought of something very funny. before [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] could ask, they took control of the body and made them float in the air before letting a large wave of fire erupt from their hands. Horrified, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] explained that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] had taken over and caused that because she thought it would be funny. They quickly ran inside before more people started staring at them. they were guided up the stairs and into the councillor's office, where [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] sat. Keith had his feet on the desk while Steve, who was wearing a white and [[Other Information/Gold\|gold]] clock and holding a shepherd crook, was standing reading a document at a table. When [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the Party]] walked, they immediately rose to attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 33\|Session 33]]              | Before they could do anything, they heard a loud bang and a lot of screams. Almost on impulse, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ran towards the screams with exasperated [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Keith Horrigan\|Keith Horrigan]] struggling to keep up behind them. Running onto the streets, they found a possessed [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]], who must have snuck away at some point when entering the city, now possessed by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who was firing beams of energy aimed to kill as many people as possible with at least a dozen already dead around him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]]          | [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Xekai\|Xekai]]'s purple portal opens just outside of [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Yakawa\|Yakawa]], and off in the distance they can see [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] drawing in the mud with a stick as he waits for them. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] decides not to go through the portal, instead opting to travel to '[[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] to cure his Mummy Rot at the Temple of [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and ensure the horse and carriage are safe. Drache rushes up to meet them and exclaims that they look like shit and that he only left them for a few days. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] runs up to meet him gives him a massive hug and starts to explain the events of the last few days with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s cult in [[Locations/OFC/Silkhorn\|Silkhorn]], [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] and [[Locations/OFC/Whitespire/The Pyramid\|The Pyramid]]. Drache is shocked that they attempted the Pyramid without him, but [[The Party/Dead/Kal The Korrigan †\|Kal The Korrigan †]] explains that it was necessary as the Mummy Lord was becoming more active. He also asked if he got the message he sent with [Animals Messenger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1994-animal-messenger) about their plans, but Drache has no recollection of ever receiving the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 21\|Session 21]]          | Chenris, who stayed with the cart, calls down to see if anything of note is happening. Korrigan calls him and down to explain their situation while Mordecai exclaims that he would like to join [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]'s hero cult so he can be worshiped, he now notably doesn't want to look at the pond anymore. Aidan shoots an arrow into the pond, and watches in amazement as it turns into gold. Korrigan asks Mordecai to prove that he is a God, angering him further to the point where he strikes and throws the fey to his neighs and nods in satisfaction at his work. Now pissed, Chenris [Commands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command) Mordecai to "Dispel" to which they cast [Dispel Magic]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) on the Magical Tinkering found on the cart. Chenris says "wrong move" and grapples the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] to force him to look at his reflection, causing him to attack with [Shocking Grasp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shocking-grasp). From their point of view the deformed [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] reaches out and scratches Mordecai causing panic to settle in. Chenris shouts that this is a curse and he needs to snap out of it. The [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] now starts climb down his throat making him gag and struggle to breath. Chenris hold firm and does not realise the boy as the [[Other Information/Races/Tiefling\|Tiefling]] is now climbing down his throat. It climbs into the body and cuts his face with its tail causing it bleed heavily, so heavily that the [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] body also bleeds away - realising Mordecai from the curse. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 19\|Session 19]]          | Worried about the state of the town and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Azel †\|Azel †]], they decide to go find [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] suggests that asking [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Bridges\|Captain Bridges]] might be the best bet since they were meant to be working quite closely together. As they make their way through the town they find that the majority of people are wearing brown robes and hoods and that people seem very happy. upon closure look, Korrigan finds out that the people under the hoods are surprisingly not just humans, but many other races.

Although things seem idealic, investigating his room said otherwise when an ornate dagger was found under his bed and bedsheets out the window - an obvious escape plan. Steve is very confused.

Using illusions, Mordecai tricked him into relinquishing the page, but the man’s anguish summoned [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]].

### Trivia
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] James originally planned for [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to kill Steve because he was so racist and so had to quickly develop a back story for him since [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] showed no sign of letting him go. >:)
