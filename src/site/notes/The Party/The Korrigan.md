   > "MY NAME IS KA1 THE KORRIGAN, HERALD OF LORWYN - AND YOU WILL NOW KNOW FEAR!!"<cite>[[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] - [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 44\|Session 44]]</cite>

### Overview  
Korrigan is a human-fey hybrid and serves as the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He is a multi-classed Ranger and Druid recognised for utilising a powerful lightning bow and fey magic. Initially, he joined [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] under the name [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] but perished during a confrontation with a Wyvern on the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. Subsequently, he re-joined [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in a new form, initially devoid of most of his memories. Through interactions with reminiscences of his past, he gradually regained a significant portion of his memories. Korrigan shared a close bond with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], one of the few individuals capable of understanding him and discerning when he was untruthful. He is portrayed by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]].  
  
### Personality  
Korrigan is characterised as a generally happy and seemingly innocent individual who prioritises the freedom of others and the protection of nature. He is known for fiercely defending friends and allies, often desiring their happiness. Beneath this cheerful exterior, Korrigan grapples with inner turmoil as he seeks to reconcile his human past with his existence as a Fey creature and the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]].  
  
### Description  
Korrigan resembles [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]], the primary distinction being the presence of a large set of antlers protruding from the sides of his head.  
  
### Backstory Summary  
Kal's early backstory has not been disclosed to the public. Following initial events, Kal fled to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], where he was deceived into joining the [[Groups & Factions/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]], subsequently enduring six years of servitude before breaking free with assistance from [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]]. After escaping, he departed from The Dawn and became associated with the Organisation of Free Cities. After his death, Kal awakened within [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] 's realm, where he negotiated a pact allowing him to return to life as the [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] to complete unfinished business in [[Locations/Lost Haven/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. In exchange, he is tasked with destroying one of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] for her amusement.
