  > "Looking in the mirror I see three faces staring back at me. None of them belong to me. Two of them are gods, and the other is dead. The worst part is that I don't know which I hate more: the fact that there are three faces that aren't mine or that I am no longer included in my own reflection." 

### Overview
An enigmatic wizard who seems to know [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], claiming that he had seen them in their dreams. They first appeared to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in their spring form and personality. 

### Personality
**Overall:** Halfbie is a very kind and caring person who wants to help their friends and loved ones. They have an incredibly curious personality and love to take things apart to fully understand the things around them. Although their appetite for learning is large, they're very aware of people's boundaries and do their best not to cross them. 
**Spring:** Halfbie has a vibrant and generally happy personality. They spend most of their time using magic to brighten their, and other peoples', day by comedically using [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2213-prestidigitation) and [[Admin/Spells/Minor Illusion\|Minor Illusion]].

### Description
**Overall:** Halfbie is a tall and well-built Eldarin with a pretty face and Purple eyes. 
**Spring:** They have green hair with eye-level bangs and face-framing pieces on either side that stretch down to their chin, with the rest of their hair being tied back into a long ponytail that reaches halfway down their back. They wear nice clothes that have been dressed down in various ways, for example, the sleeves are rolled up and the top buttons of the shirt are undone as they find it easier to move in. They also wear quite colourful clothing, reflecting their bright personality.
